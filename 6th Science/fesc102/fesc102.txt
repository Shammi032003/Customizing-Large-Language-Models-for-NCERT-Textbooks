2.1 O BJECTS  AROUND  US
We have seen that our food and clothes
have so much variety in them. Not just
food and clothes, there is such a vast
variety of objects everywhere. We see
around us, a chair, a bullock cart, a
cycle, cooking utensils, books, clothes,
toys, water, stones and many other
objects. All these objects have different
shapes, colours and uses (Fig. 2.1).
Look around and identify objects
that are round in shape. Our list may
include a rubber ball, a football and a
glass marble. If we include objects that
are nearly round, our list could also
include objects like apples, oranges, and
an earthen pitcher ( gharha).Let us say, we wish to make a group
of objects that are made of plastics.
Buckets, lunch boxes, toys, water
containers, pipes and many such
objects, may find a place in this group.
There are so many ways to group objects!
In the above examples we have grouped
objects on the basis of their shape or the
materials they are made from.
All objects around us are made of one
or more materials. These materials may
be glass, metal, plastics, wood, cotton,
paper, mud or soil. Can you think of
more examples of materials?
Activity 1
Let us collect as many objects as
possible, from around us. Each of uscould get some everyday objects from
home and we could also collect some
objects from the classroom or fromoutside the school. What will we havein our collection? Chalk, pencil,notebook, rubber, duster, a hammer,nail, soap, spoke of a wheel, bat,matchbox, salt, potato. We can also listobjects that we can think of, but, cannot
bring to the classroom. For example,
wall, trees, doors, tractor, road.
Separate all objects from this
collection that are made from paper orwood. This way we have divided all objects

into two groups. One group has theobjects that are made from paper or woodwhile the other group has the objects
that are not made of these materials.
Similarly, we could separate the thingsthat are used for preparing food.
Let us be a little more systematic. List
all objects collected, in Table 2.1. Try toidentify the materials that each one is
made of. It would be fun to make this a
large table – collecting informationabout as many objects as possible. It
may seem difficult to find out the
materials out of which some of theseobjects are made. In such cases, discuss
with your friends, teacher and parents
to identify the materials.

materials, and list them in Column 2.Table 2.2 Different types of objects

First, we grouped objects in manydifferent ways. We then found that
objects around us are made of differentmaterials. At times, an object is made of
a single material. An object could also
be made of many materials. And thenagain, one material could be used for
making many different objects.  What
decides which material should be usedfor making any given object? It seems

Fig. 2.2  Using a cloth tumblerthat we need to know more about
different materials.
2.2 P ROPERTIES  OF MATERIALS
Have you ever wondered why a tumbleris not made with a piece of cloth? Keepin mind that we generally use a tumbler
to keep a liquid. Therefore, would it not
be silly, if we were to make a tumblerout of cloth (Fig 2.2)! What we need for
a tumbler is glass, plastics, metal or
other such material that will hold water.Similarly, it would not be wise to use
paper-like materials for cooking vessels.
We see then, that we choose a
material to make an object dependingAppearance
Materials usually look different from
each other. Wood looks very different
from iron. Iron appears different from
copper or aluminium. At the same time,there may be some similarities between
iron, copper and aluminium that are not
there in wood.
Activity 3
Collect small pieces of different materials –
paper, cardboard, wood, copper wire,
aluminium sheet, chalk. Do any of theseappear shiny? Separate the shiny
materials into a group.
Now, observe as the teacher cuts each
material into two pieces and look at thefreshly cut surface (Fig. 2.3). What do
you notice? Does the freshly cut surfaceof some of these materials appear shiny?
Include these objects also in the group
of shiny materials.
Do you notice such a shine or lustre
in the other materials, cut them anywayas you can? Repeat this in the class withas many materials as possible and make
a list of those with and without lustre.
Instead of cutting, you can rub thesurface of material with sand paper to
see if it has lustre.
Fig. 2.3  Cutting pieces of materials to see if
they have lustreon its properties, and the purpose for
which the object is to be used.
So, what are all the properties of
materials that would be important fortheir usage? Some properties arediscussed here.
Rationalised 2023-24
14 SCIENCE
Fig. 2.4  What disappears, what doesn’t?Materials that have such lustre are
usually metals. Iron, copper, aluminium
and gold are examples of metals. Some
metals often lose their shine and
appear dull, because of the action of airand moisture on them. We therefore,
notice the lustre, only on their freshly
cut surface. When you visit anironsmith or a workshop, look out for
freshly cut surfaces of metal rods to see
if they have lustre.
Hardness
When you press different materials withyour hands, some of them may be hard
to compress while others can be easily
compressed. Take a metal key and tryto scratch with it, the surface of a piece
of wood, aluminium, a piece of stone, a
nail, candle, chalk, any other materialor object. You can easily scratch some
materials, while some cannot be
scratched so easily. Materials which canbe compressed or scratched easily are
called soft while some other materials
which are difficult to compress are called
hard. For example, cotton or sponge is
soft while iron is hard.
In appearance, materials can have
different properties, like lustre,
hardness, be rough or smooth. Can you
think of other properties that describethe appearance of a material?
Soluble or Insoluble?
Activity 4
Collect samples of some solid substances
such as sugar, salt, chalk powder, sand
and sawdust. Take five glasses orbeakers. Fill each one of them about two-thirds with water. Add a small amount(spoonful) of sugar to the first glass,
salt to the second and similarly, add
small amounts of the other substancesinto the other glasses. Stir the contents
of each of them with a spoon. Wait for a
few minutes. Observe what happens tothe substances added to water (Fig. 2.4).
Note your observations as shown
in Table 2.3.

Collect samples of vinegar, lemon juice,

any other liquid. Take a glass tumbler.Fill it up to half with water. Add a few
spoonfuls of one liquid to this and stir
it well. Let it stand for five minutes.Observe whether the liquid mixes with
water (Fig. 2.5). Repeat the same with
other liquids, as many different liquidsas are available to you. Write your
observations in Table 2.4.

live in water.

While doing Activity 4, you might have
noticed that the insoluble solids
separated out from water. You may havealso noticed this with some liquids in
Activity 5.  Some of these materials that
did not mix with water, floated to thesurface of water. Others may have sunk
to the bottom of the tumbler, right? We
notice many examples of objects thatfloat in water or sink (Fig. 2.6). Dried

Boojho would like you to give him
five examples each, of objects that floatand those that sink in water. What
about testing these same materials tosee if they float or sink in other liquids
like oil?
Transparency
You might have played the game of hide
and seek. Think of some places whereyou would like to hide so that you are
not seen by others. Why did you choose
those places? Would you have tried tohide behind a glass window? Obviouslynot, as your friends can see through thatand spot you. Can you see through all
the materials? Those substances or
materials, through which things can beseen, are called transparent (Fig. 2.7).
Glass, water, air and some plastics are
examples of transparent materials.Shopkeepers usually prefer to keep
biscuits, sweets  and other eatables in
transparent containers of glass or
plastic, so that buyers can easily see
these items (Fig. 2.8).
On the other hand, there are some
materials through which you are notable to see. These materials are called
opaque. You cannot tell what is keptin a closed wooden box, a cardboard
carton or a metal container. Wood,
cardboard and metals, are examples ofopaque materials.
Do we find that we can group all
materials and objects, without anyconfusion, as either opaque or
transparent?

paper. Look again towards the lightedbulb through that portion of the paper
on which the oil has been spread. Do
you find that the bulb is more clearlyvisible than before?  But, can you see
clearly through the oiled paper? Is
everything on the other side of it visible?Perhaps not. The materials through
which objects can be seen, but not
clearly, are known as translucent .
Remember the oily patch on paper when
we tested food items for presence of fats?
That was translucent too. Can youthink of some more examples of
translucent materials?
We can therefore group materials as
opaque, transparent and translucent.

covering the glass
of a torch with your
palm at a dark
place. Switch onthe torch and

side of the palm.She wants to knowwhether palm of your hand is opaque,transparent or translucent?
We learnt that materials differ in their
appearance and the way they mix inwater or other liquids. They may floator sink in water or may be transparent,
opaque or translucent. Materials can be
grouped on the basis of similarities ordifferences in their properties.
Why do we need to group materials?
In everyday life, we often group materialsfor our convenience. At home, we
usually store things in such a manner
that similar objects are placed together.Such an arrangement helps us to locate
them easily. Similarly, a grocer usually
keeps all type of biscuits at one cornerof his shop, all soaps at another while
grains and pulses are stored at some
other place.
There is another reason why we find
such grouping useful. Dividingmaterials in groups makes it convenientto study their properties and also
observe any patterns in these properties.
We will study more about this inhigher classes.
