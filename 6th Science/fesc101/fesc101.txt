1 COMPONENTS  OF FOOD

In lower classes, we made lists of the
food items that we eat. We also
identified food items eaten in
different parts of India and marked
these on its map.
A meal could consist of  chapati, dal
and brinjal curry. Another may be rice,sambar and a vegetable preparation of
lady’s finger  (bhindi). Yet another meal
could be appam , fish curry and
vegetables.curd, butter milk and pickles. Some
examples of meals from different regions
are given in Table 1.1. Select food itemsand enter these in Table 1.1.
Sometimes, we may not really have
all this variety in our meals. If we aretravelling, we may eat whatever is
available on the way. It may not be
possible for some of us, to eat such avariety of items, most of the time.
There must be some reason though,
why meals usually consist of such adistribution. Do you think that our body
needs different kinds of food for some
special purpose?

We know that each dish is usually madeup of one or more ingredients, which
we get from plants or animals. Theseingredients contain some components
that are needed by our body. TheseComponents of Food

Fig. 1.1  Testing for starchcomponents are called nutrients . The
major nutrients in our food are named
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins
and minerals. In addition, food contains
dietary fibres and water which are also
needed by our body.
Do all foods contain all these
nutrients? With some simple methodswe can test whether cooked food or a
raw ingredient contains one or more of
these nutrients. The tests for presenceof carbohydrates, proteins and fats
are simpler to do as compared to the
tests for other nutrients. Let us do these
tests and record all our observations
in Table 1.2.
For carrying out these tests, you will
need solutions of iodine, coppersulphate and caustic soda. You will also
need a few test tubes and a dropper.
Try these tests on cooked food items
as well as raw materials. Table 1.2 shows
you a way to record the observationsfrom these tests. Some food items are
given in this table. You can conduct the
tests either with these or any other
available food items. Do these tests
carefully and do not try to eat or taste
any chemicals.
If the required solutions are not
available in readymade form, yourteacher can prepare them as given in
the box.
Let us begin by testing different
food items to see if they containcarbohydrates . There are many
types of carbohydrates. The main
carbohydrates found in our food are in
the form of starch and sugars. We can
easily test if a food item contains starch.Activity 2
Test for Starch
Take a small quantity of a food item or
a raw ingredient. Put 2-3 drops of diluteiodine solution on it (Fig. 1.1). Observe
if there is any change in the colour of
the food item. Did it turn blue-black?A blue-black colour indicates that it
contains starch.e b n a c e n i d o i f o n o i t u l o s e t u l i d A

Repeat this test with other food items
to find out which of these contain starch.
Enter all your observations in Table 1.2.

Put some of this in a clean testtube, add 10 drops of water to it
and shake the test tube.
Now, using a dropper, add
two drops of solution of coppersulphate and ten drops of
solution of caustic soda to thetest tube (Fig. 1.2). Shake welland let the test tube stand for a fewminutes. What do you see? Did thecontents of the test tube turn violet? A
violet colour indicates presence of
proteins in the food item.
Now, you can repeat this test on other
food items.

and carbohydrates are also called
‘energy giving foods’ (Fig. 1.3 andFig. 1.4).
Proteins are needed for the growth
and repair of our body. Foods proteinsTest for Fats
Take a small quantity of a food item.Wrap it in a piece of paper and crush it.
Take care that the paper does not tear.
Now, straighten the paper and observeit carefully. Does it have an oily patch?
Hold the paper against light. Are you
able to see the light faintly, throughthis patch?
An oily patch on paper shows that
the food item contains fat. The food
items may sometimes contain a little
water. Therefore, after you have rubbedan item on paper, let the paper dry for awhile. If there were any water that mayhave come from food, it would dry upafter some time. If no oily patch shows
up after this, the food item does not
contain any fat.
What do these tests show? Are fats,
proteins and starch present in all thefood items that you tested? Does a food
item contain more than one nutrient?
Do you find any food item that does notcontain any of these nutrients?
We tested food items for three
nutrients — carbohydrates, proteinsand fats. There are also other nutrients
like vitamins and minerals  that are
present in different food items. Why do
we need all these nutrients?
1.2 W HAT DO VARIOUS  NUTRIENTS  DO
FOR OUR BODY?
Carbohydrates mainly provide energyto our body. Fats also give us energy.
In fact, fats give much more energy
as compared to the same amount ofcarbohydrates. Foods containing fatsFig. 1.3  Some sources of carbohydrates

are often called ‘body building foods’
(Fig 1.5).
Vitamins help in protecting our body
against diseases. Vitamins also help inkeeping our eyes, bones, teeth and gums
healthy.
Vitamins are of different kinds
known by different names. Some of these
are Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D,Vitamin E and K. There is also a group
of vitamins called Vitamin B-complex.
Our body needs all types of vitamins insmall quantities. Vitamin A keeps ourskin and eyes healthy. Vitamin C helpsbody to fight against many diseases.
Vitamin D helps our body to use
calcium for bones and teeth. Foods thatare rich in different vitamins are shown
in Fig. 1.6 to Fig. 1.9.
Minerals are needed by our body in
small amounts. Each one is essential

for proper growth of body and to
maintain good health. Some sources of
different minerals are shown in Fig. 1.10.
Most food items, usually, have more
than one nutrient. You may have noticedthis, while recording your observationsin Table 1.2. However, in a given raw
material, one particular nutrient may
be present in much larger quantity thanin others. For example, rice has more
carbohydrates than other nutrients.
Thus, we say that rice is a “carbohydraterich” source of food.
Besides these nutrients, our body
needs dietary fibres  and water. Dietary
fibres are also known as roughage.
Roughage is mainly provided by plant
products in our foods. Whole grains andpulses, potatoes, fresh fruits and
vegetables are main sources of roughage.
Roughage does not provide any nutrientto our body, but is an essential
component of our food and adds to its
bulk. This helps our body get rid of
undigested food.Our body also
prepares Vitamin D in the
presence of sunlight. Nowadays,
insufficient exposure to sunlight is
causing Vitamin D deficiency in
many people.

think that, what we need for a balanced
diet would depend on the amount ofphysical work that we do?
Prepare a chart of whatever you eat
over a period of a week. Check whetherall the nutrients mentioned are present
in one or the other food items being
eaten within a day or so.
Pulses, groundnut, soyabean,
sprouted seeds ( moong  and Bengal
gram), fermented foods (South Indianfoods such as idlis), a combination of
flours ( missi roti , thepla  made from
cereals and pulses), banana, spinach,sattu , jaggery, available vegetables and
other such foods provide manynutrients. Therefore, one can eat abalanced diet without expensive food
materials.
Eating the right kind of food is not
enough. It should also be cookedWater helps our body to absorb
nutrients from food. It also helps in
throwing out some wastes from body as
urine and sweat. Normally, we get most
of the water that our body needs fromthe liquids we drink — such as water,
milk and tea. In addition, we add water
to most cooked foods. Let’s see if thereis any other source which provides water
to our body.
Activity 3
Take a tomato or a fruit like lemon. Cut
it into small pieces. Do your hands getwet while doing so?
Carefully observe whenever
vegetables and fruits are being cut,peeled, grated or mashed at your
home. Do you find any fresh vegetables
or fruits that do not contain someamount of water?
We see that many food materials
themselves contain water. To some
extent, our body needs are met by thiswater. Apart from this, we also add waterwhile cooking many food items.
1.3 B ALANCED  DIET
The food we normally eat in a day is our
diet. For growth and maintenance ofgood health, our diet should have all
the nutrients that our body needs, in
right quantities. Not too much of oneand not too little of the other.  The diet
should also contain a good amount of
roughage and water. Such a diet is calleda balanced diet .

need the same type of diet? Do you alsoPaheli wonders whether animal
food also consists of thesedifferent components and dothey also need a balanced diet?
properly so that its nutrients are not
lost. Are you aware that some nutrientsget lost in the process of cooking and
preparations?
If the vegetables and fruits are
washed after cutting or peeling them, it
Rationalised 2023-24
8 SCIENCE
may result in the loss of some vitamins.
The skins of many vegetables and fruitscontain vitamins and minerals.
Similarly, repeated washing of rice and
pulses may remove some vitamins andminerals present in them.
We all know that cooking improves
the taste of food and makes it easier todigest. At the same time, cooking also
results in the loss of certain nutrients.
Many useful proteins and considerableamounts of minerals are lost if excess
water is used during cooking and is
then thrown away.
Vitamin C gets easily destroyed by
heat during cooking. Would it not besensible to include some fruits and rawvegetables in our diet?
Boojho thought that fats would be
the best foods to eat, all the time. A katori
(bowl) of fat will give much more energy
than a katori of carbohydrate rich food,
isn’t it? So, he ate nothing but food richin fats — fried food like samosa  and poori
(snacks), malai,  rabdi  and peda (sweets).
Do you think he was right? No, of
course not! It can be very harmful for
us to eat too much of fat rich foods andwe may end up suffering from a
condition called obesity.
1.4 D EFICIENCY  DISEASES
A person may be getting enough food toeat, but sometimes the food may not
contain a particular nutrient. If thiscontinues over a long period of time, the
person may suffer from its deficiency.
Deficiency of one or more nutrients can
cause diseases or disorders in our body.
Diseases that occur due to lack of
nutrients over a long period are calleddeficiency diseases .
If a person does not get enough
proteins in his/her food for  a long time,he/she is likely to have stunted growth,
swelling of face, discolouration of hair,
skin diseases and diarrhoea.
If the diet is deficient in both
carbohydrates and proteins for a longperiod of time, the growth may stop
completely. Such a person becomes very
lean and thin and so weak that he/shemay not even be able to move.
Deficiency of different vitamins and
minerals may also result in certain
diseases or disorders. Some of these are
mentioned in Table 1.3.
All deficiency diseases can be
prevented by taking a balanced diet.

the reason why widely varying food fromdifferent regions had a common
