104 SCIENCE10 Fun with Magnets
Paheli and Boojho went to a place
where a lot of waste material was
piled into huge heaps. Something
exciting was happening! A crane was
moving towards the heap of junk. The
long hand of the crane lowered a block
over a heap. It then began to move.Guess, what? Many pieces of iron junk
were sticking to the block, as it moved
away (Fig. 10.1)!sticking to the holder. In some pencilboxes, the lid fits tightly when we close
it even without a locking arrangement.
Such stickers, pin holders and pencilboxes have magnets fitted inside
(Fig. 10.2). If you have any one of these
items, try to locate the magnets hiddenin these.

They had just read a very interesting
book on magnets and knew immediatelythat there must be a magnet attachedto the end of the crane that was picking
up iron from the junk yard.
You might have seen magnets and
have even enjoyed playing with them.Have you seen stickers that remain
attached  to iron surfaces like almirahsor the doors of refrigerators? In some

How Magnets Were Discovered
It is said that, there was a shepherdnamed Magnes, who lived in ancient
Greece.  He used to take his herd ofsheep and goats to the nearby
mountains for grazing.  He would take
a stick with him to control his herd. Thestick had a small piece of iron attached
at one end.  One day he was surprised
to find that he had to pull hard tofree his stick from a rock on the

105 FUN WITH MAGNETSmountainside (Fig. 10.3). It seemed as
if the stick was being attracted by the
rock. The rock was a natural magnetand it attracted the iron tip of the
shepherd's stick. It is said that this is
how natural magnets were discovered.Such rocks were given the name
magnetite, perhaps after the name of that
shepherd. Magnetite contains iron.
Some people believe that magnetite was
first discovered at a place called
Magnesia. The substances having theproperty of attracting iron are now known
as magnets.  This is how the story goes.
In any case, people now have
discovered that certain rocks have theproperty of attracting pieces of iron. They
also found that small pieces of theserocks have some special properties.
They named these naturally occurring
materials magnets. Later on the processof making magnets from pieces of iron
was discovered. These are known as
artificial magnets. Nowadays artificialmagnets are prepared in different
shapes. For example, bar magnet, horse-
shoe magnet, cylindrical or a ball-endedmagnet. Fig.10.4 shows a few such
magnets.
Activity 1
Take a plastic or a paper cup. Fix it on a
stand with the help of a clamp as shown
in Fig. 10.5. Place a magnet inside the
cup and cover it with a paper so that
the magnet is not visible. Attach a
thread to a clip made of iron. Fix theother end of the thread at the base of
the stand. (Mind you, the trick involved
here, is to keep the length of the threadsufficiently short.) Bring the clip near
the base of the cup. The clip is raised in
air without support, like a kite.Fig. 10.4  Magnets of different shapes

Activity 2
Let us walk in the footsteps of Magnes.
Only, this time, we will change the
positions of the magnet and the iron.There will be a magnet at the end of our
shepherd's stick. We can attach a small
magnet to a hockey stick, walking stickor a cricket wicket with a tape or some
glue. Let us now go out on a "Magnes
walk" through the school playground.What does our "Magnes stick" pick up
from the school ground? What about
objects in the classroom?
Collect various objects of day-to-day
use from your surroundings.  Test thesewith the "Magnes stick". You can alsotake a magnet, touch these objects with
it and observe which objects stick to the
magnet. Prepare a table in yournotebook as shown in Table 10.1. and
record your observations.
Look at the last column of Table 10.1
and note the objects that are attractedby a magnet. Now, make a list ofmaterials from which these objects are
made. Is there any material common in
all the objects that were attracted by
the magnet?
We understand that magnet
attracts certain materials whereas somedo not get attracted towards magnet.
The materials which get attractedtowards a magnet are magnetic – for
example, iron, nickel or cobalt.  Thematerials which are not attractedtowards a magnet are non-magnetic .
What materials did you find to be non-magnetic from Table 10.1? Is soil amagnetic or a non-magnetic material?

107 FUN WITH MAGNETSIf you fill this table and send it to
Paheli and Boojho, they can compare
the amount of iron filings found in soil
from different parts of the country. They
can share this information with you.
10.2 P OLES OF MAGNET
We observed that iron filings (if they arepresent) stick to a magnet rubbed in thesoil. Did you observe anything special
about the way they stick to the magnet?
Activity 4
Spread some iron filings on a sheet ofpaper.  Now, place a bar magnet on this
sheet. What do you observe?  Do the ironfilings stick all over the magnet?  Do you
observe that more iron filings get attracted
to some parts of the magnet than others(Fig. 10.7)? Remove the iron filings
sticking to the magnet and repeat theActivity 3
Rub a magnet in the sand or soil.   Pull
out the magnet. Are there some particlesof sand or soil sticking to the magnet?
Now, gently shake the magnet to remove
the particles of sand or soil. Are someparticles still sticking to it? These might
be small pieces of iron (iron filings)
picked up from the soil.
Through such an activity, we can
find out whether the soil or sand from agiven place contains particles that haveiron. Try this activity near your home,
school or the places you visit on your
holidays. Does the magnet with ironfilings sticking to it, look like any one
of those shown in Fig. 10.6?
 Make  a table of what you find.

to two ends of a bar magnet. Poles of a
magnet are said to be near these ends.Try and bring a few magnets of different
shapes to the classroom. Check for the
location of the poles on these magnetsusing iron filings. Can you now mark the
location of poles in the kind of magnets
shown in Fig. 10.4?
10.3 F INDING  DIRECTIONS
Magnets were known to people from
ancient times. Many properties of
magnets were also known to them. You
might have read many interesting
stories about the uses of magnets. One
such story is about an emperor in China
named Hoang Ti. It is said that he had
a chariot with a statue of a lady thatcould rotate in any direction. It had an
extended arm as if it was showing the
way (Fig. 10.8). The statue had an
interesting property.  It would rest in
such a position that its extended armalways pointed towards South. By
looking at the extended arm of the
statue, the Emperor was able to locate
directions when he went to new places
on his chariot.Let us make such a direction finder
for ourselves.
Activity 5
Take a bar magnet.  Put a mark on one
of its ends for identification. Now, tie athread at the middle of the magnet so
that you may suspend it from a wooden
stand (Fig. 10.9). Make sure that themagnet can rotate freely. Let it come to
rest.  Mark two points on the ground to
show the position of the ends of themagnet when it comes to rest. Draw aPaheli has this puzzle for you.You are given two identical barswhich look as if they might be
made of iron. One of them is a
magnet, while the other is asimple iron bar. How will
you find out, which one
is a magnet?

109 FUN WITH MAGNETSline joining the two points. This line
shows the direction in which the magnetwas pointing in its position of rest. Now,
rotate the magnet by gently pushing one
end in any direction and let it come torest. Again, mark the position of the two
ends in its position of rest. Does the
magnet now point in a differentdirection? Rotate the magnet in other
directions and note the final direction
in which it comes to rest.
Do you find that the magnet always
comes to rest in the same direction?Now can you guess the mystery behindthe statue in the Emperor's chariot?
Repeat this activity with an iron bar
and a plastic or a wooden scale insteadof a magnet. Do not use light objects for
this activity and avoid doing it where
there are currents of air. Do the othermaterials also always come to rest in the
same direction?
We find that a freely suspended bar
magnet always comes to rest in aparticular direction, which is the North-South direction. Use the direction of the
rising sun in the morning to find out
the rough direction towards east, whereyou are doing this experiment. If youstand facing east, to your left will beNorth. Using the Sun for findingdirections may not be very exact, but, it
will help to make out the direction
North from the South, on your line.Using this you can figure out which endof the magnet is pointing to the Northand which points to the South.
The end of the magnet that points
towards North is called its North seekingend or the North pole of the magnet. The
other end that points towards the Southis called South seeking end or the South
pole of the magnet. All magnets have two
poles whatever their shape may be.Usually, north (N) and south (S) poles
are marked on the magnets.
This property of the magnet is very
useful for us.  For centuries, travellershave been making use of this property
of magnets to find directions. It is saidthat in olden days, travellers used to find
directions by suspending natural
magnets with a thread, which they
always carried with them.
Later on, a device was developed
based on this property of magnets. It isknown as the compass.  A compass is
usually a small box with a glass coveron it. A magnetised needle is pivoted
inside the box, which can rotate freely
(Fig. 10.10). The compass also has a dial
Fig. 10.10   A compass
In which direction is the maingate of your school situated fromyour classroom?
Rationalised 2023-24
110 SCIENCE
with directions marked on it. The
compass is kept at the place where wewish to know the directions. Its needle
indicates the north-south direction
when it comes to rest. The compass isthen rotated until the north and south
marked on the dial are at the two ends
of the needle.  To identify the north-poleof the magnetic needle, it is usually
painted in a different colour.
10.4 M AKE YOUR OWN MAGNET
There are several methods of makingmagnets. Let us learn the simplest one.
Take a rectangular piece of iron. Placeit on the table. Now take a bar magnet
and place one of its poles near one edge
of the bar of iron. Without lifting thebar magnet, move it along the length of
the iron bar till you reach the other end.
Now, lift the magnet and bring the pole(the same pole you started with) to the
same point of the iron bar from which
you began (Fig. 10.11). Move the magnetagain along the iron bar in the same
direction as you did before.  Repeat this
process about 30-40 times. Bring a pinor some iron filings near the iron bar to
check whether it has become a magnet.
If not, continue the process for somemore time. Remember that the pole ofthe magnet and the direction of itsmovement should not change.  You can
also use an iron nail, a needle or a blade
and convert them into a magnet.
You now know how to make a
magnet. Would you like to make yourown compass?
Activity 6
Magnetise an iron
needle using a bar
magnet. Now, insertthe magnetised
needle through a
small piece of cork orfoam.  Let the cork
float in water in a
bowl or a tub. Makesure that the needle
does not touch the water (Fig. 10.12).
Your compass is now ready to work.
Make a note of the direction in which
the needle points when the cork isfloating. Rotate the cork, with the needle
fixed in it, in different directions. Note
the direction in which the needle pointswhen the cork begins to float again
without rotating. Does the needle always
point in the same direction, when thecork stops rotating?
10.5 A TTRACTION  AND REPULSION
BETWEEN  MAGNETS
Let us play another interesting gamewith magnets.  Take two small toy cars
and label them A and B. Place a bar
magnet on top of each car along itslength and fix them with rubber bandsFig. 10.12   A

Rationalised 2023-24
111 FUN WITH MAGNETS(Fig. 10.13). In car A, keep the south
pole of the magnet towards its front.
Place the magnet in opposite direction
in car B. Now, place the two cars closeto one another (Fig. 10.13). What do you
observe? Do the cars remain at their
places? Do the cars run away from eachother? Do they move towards each other
and collide? Record your observations
in a table as shown in Table 10.3. Now,place the toy cars close to each other
such that the rear side of car A faces
the front side of car B (Fig 10.14). Dothey move as before? Note the direction
in which the cars move now.  Next, place
the car A behind car B and note thedirection in which they move in each
case. Repeat the activity by placing carswith their rear sides facing each other.
Record your observations in each case.
What do we find from this activity?
Do two similar poles attract or repel eachother? What about opposite poles — do
they attract or repel each other?
This property of the magnets can also
be observed by suspending a magnetand bringing one by one the poles of
another magnet near it.
