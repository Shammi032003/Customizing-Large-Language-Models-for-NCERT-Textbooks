Finding out what happened
Yesterday: you could listen to the radio, watch 
television, read a newspaper.
Last year: ask somebody who remembers.
But what about long, long ago? Let us see how it 
can be done. 
What can we know about the past?
There are several things we can find out — what 
people ate, the kinds of clothes they wore, the 
houses in which they lived. We can find out 
about the lives of hunters, herders, farmers, 
rulers, merchants, priests, craftspersons, artists, 
musicians, and scientists. We can also find out 
about the games children played, the stories they 
heard, the plays they saw, the songs they sang.
Where did people live?
Find the river Narmada on Map 1 (page 2). People 
have lived along the banks of this river for several 
hundred thousand years. Some of the earliest 
people who lived here were skilled gatherers, — 
that is, people who gathered their food. They knew 
about the vast wealth of plants in the surrounding 
forests, and collected roots, fruits and other forest 
produce for their food. They also hunted animals. 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION:  
WHAT, WHERE, HOW AND WHEN?
Rasheeda’s question
Rasheeda sat reading the newspaper. Suddenly, her 
eyes fell on a small headline: “One Hundred Years 
Ago.” How, she wondered, could anyone know what

agriculture developed. The places where rice was 
first grown are to the north of the Vindhyas. 
Trace the river Indus and its tributaries 
(tributaries are smaller rivers that flow into a larger 
river). About 4700 years ago, some of the earliest 
cities flourished on the banks of these rivers. Later, 
about 2500 years ago, cities developed on the 
banks of the Ganga and its tributaries, and along 
the sea coasts. 
Locate the Ganga and its tributary called the 
Son. In ancient times, the area along these rivers 
to the south of the Ganga was known as Magadha 
now lying in the state of Bihar. Its rulers were very 
powerful, and set up a large kingdom. Kingdoms 
were set up in other parts of the country as well.   
Throughout, people travelled from one part of 
the subcontinent to another. The hills and high 
mountains including the Himalayas, deserts, rivers 
and seas made journeys dangerous at times, but 
never impossible. So, men and women moved in 
search of livelihood, as also to escape from natural 
disasters like floods or droughts. Sometimes men 
marched in armies, conquering others’ lands. 
Besides, merchants travelled with caravans or 
ships, carrying valuable goods from place to place. 
And religious teachers walked from village to village, 
town to town, stopping to offer instruction and 
advice on the way. Finally, some people perhaps 
travelled driven by a spirit of adventure, wanting 
to discover new and exciting places. All these led 
to the sharing of ideas between people. 
Why do people travel nowadays? 
Look at Map 1 once more. Hills, mountains and 
seas form the natural frontiers of the subcontinent. 
While it was difficult to cross these frontiers, those 
who wanted could and did scale the mountains

and cross the seas. People from across the frontiers 
also came into the subcontinent and settled here. 
These movements of people enriched our cultural 
traditions. People have shared new ways of carving 
stone, composing music, and even cooking food over 
several hundreds of years. 
Names of the land
Two of the words we often use for our country are 
India and Bharat. The word India comes from the 
Indus, called Sindhu in Sanskrit. Find Iran and 
Greece in your atlas. The Iranians and the Greeks 
who came through the northwest about 2500 years 
ago and were familiar with the Indus, called it the 
Hindos or the Indos, and the land to the east of 
the river was called India. The name Bharata was 
used for a group of people who lived in the north-
west, and who are mentioned in the Rigveda, the 
earliest composition in Sanskrit (dated to about 
3500 years ago). Later it was used for the country. 
Finding out about the past
There are several ways of finding out about the 
past. One is to search for and read books that were 
written long ago. These are called manuscripts, 
because they were written by hand (this comes from 
the Latin word ‘manu’, meaning hand). These were 
usually written on palm leaf, or on the specially 
prepared bark of a tree known as the birch, which 
grows in the Himalayas.

This manuscript was 
written about a thousand 
years ago. The palm 
leaves were cut into 
pages and tied together 
to make books. To see a

introduction: what, 
where, how and when?
Over the years, many manuscripts were eaten 
away by insects, some were destroyed, but many 
have survived, often preserved in temples and 
monasteries. These books dealt with all kinds of 
subjects: religious beliefs and practices, the lives 
of kings, medicine and science. Besides, there were 
epics, poems, plays. Many of these were written in 
Sanskrit, others were in Prakrit (languages used 
by ordinary people) and Tamil.  
We can also study inscriptions. These are writings 
on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal. 
Sometimes, kings got their orders inscribed so 
that people could see, read and obey them. There 
are other kinds of inscriptions as well, where men 
and women (including kings and queens) recorded 
what they did. For 
e x a m p l e ,  k i n g s 
often kept records 
of victories in battle. 
Can you think of 
the advantages of 
writing on a hard 
surface? And what 
could have been 
the difficulties?
There were many 
other things that 
were made and 
used in the past. 
Those who study 
these objects are called archaeologists. They study 
the remains of buildings made of stone and brick, 
paintings and sculpture. They also explore and 
excavate (dig under the surface of the earth) to 
find tools, weapons, pots, pans, ornaments and 
coins. Some of these objects may be made of stone, 
others of bone, baked clay or metal. Objects that 
are made of hard, imperishable substances usually 
survive for a long time. 
An old inscription.
This inscription dates 
to about 2250 years 
ago, and was found in 
Kandahar, present-day 
Afghanistan. It was 
inscribed on the orders 
of a ruler named Ashoka. 
You will read about him 
in Chapter 7. When we 
write anything, we use a 
script. Scripts consist of 
letters or signs. When 
we read what is written, 
or speak, we use a 
language. This inscription 
was inscribed in two 
different scripts and 
languages, Greek (top) 
and Aramaic (below), 
which were used in this 
area.

Pots like these were used

Coins such as this one 
were in use from about 
2500 years ago. 
In what ways is the coin 
different from the ones we 
use today?   
Archaeologists also look for bones — of animals, 
birds, and fish — to find out what people ate in the 
past. Plant remains survive far more rarely — if 
seeds of grain or pieces of wood have been burnt, 
they survive in a charred form. Do you think cloth 
is found frequently by archaeologists? 
Historians, that is, scholars who study the 
past, often use the word source to refer to the 
information found from manuscripts, inscriptions 
and archaeology. Once sources are found, 
learning about the past becomes an adventure, 
as we reconstruct it bit by bit. So historians and 
archaeologists are like detectives, who use all these 
sources like clues to find out about our pasts. 
One past or many? 
Did you notice the title of this book, Our Pasts? 
We have used the word ‘pasts’ in plural to draw 
attention to the fact that the past was different for 
different groups of people. For example, the lives 
of herders or farmers were different from those 
of kings and queens, the lives of merchants were 
different from those of craftspersons, and so on. 
Rationalised 2023-24

introduction: what, 
where, how and when?
Also, as is true even today, people followed different 
practices and customs in different parts of the 
country. For example, today most people living in 
the Andaman Islands get their own food by fishing, 
hunting, and collecting forest produce. By contrast, 
most people living in cities depend on others for 
supplies of food. Differences such as these existed 
in the past as well. 
Besides, there is another kind of difference. We 
know a great deal about kings and the battles they 
fought because they kept records of their victories. 
Generally, ordinary people such as hunters, fishing 
folk, gatherers, farmers or herders did not keep 
records of what they did. While archaeology helps 
us to find out about their lives, there is much that 
remains unknown. 
What do dates mean? 
If somebody asks you the date, you will probably 
mention the day, month and year, 2000 and 
something.  These years are counted from the date 
generally assigned to the birth of Jesus Christ, 
the founder of Christianity. So, 2000 means 2000 
years after the birth of Christ. All dates before the 
birth of Christ are counted backwards and usually 
have the letters BC (Before Christ) added on. In 
this book, we will refer to dates going back from 
the present, using 2000 as our starting point.

This stands for two Latin words, ‘Anno Domini’, 
meaning ‘in the year of the Lord’ (i.e. Christ). So

Sometimes CE is used instead of AD and BCE

The earliest people: why were they on the move?
We know about people who lived in the subcontinent 
as early as two million years ago. Today, we describe 
them as hunter-gatherers.  The name comes from 
the way in which they got their food. Generally, 
they hunted wild animals, caught fish and birds, 
gathered fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, leaves, stalks 
and eggs.  
Hunter-gatherers moved from place to place. 
There are many reasons for this.
First, if they had stayed at one place for a long 
time, they would have eaten up all the available 
plant and animal resources. Therefore, they would 
have had to go elsewhere in search of food. 
Second, animals move from place to place — 
either in search of smaller prey, or, in the case of 
deer and wild cattle, in search of grass and leaves. 
That is why those who hunted them had to follow 
their movements.

wedding. They were travelling by train and he had 
managed to squeeze into the window seat, his nose 
glued to the glass pane. As he watched trees and houses 
fly past, his uncle tapped his shoulder and said: “Do 
you know that trains were first used about 150 years 
ago, and that people began using buses a few decades 
later?” Tushar wondered, when people couldn’t travel 
quickly from one place to another, did they spend their 
entire lives wherever they were born? Not quite.

Third, plants and trees bear fruit in different 
seasons. So, people may have moved from season 
to season in search of different kinds of plants. 
Fourth, people, plants and animals need water 
to survive. Water is found in lakes, streams and 
rivers. While many rivers and lakes are perennial 
(with water throughout the year), others are 
seasonal. People living on their banks would have 
had to go in search of water during the dry seasons 
(winter and summer).
How do we know about these people?
Archaeologists have found some of the things 
hunter-gatherers made and used. It is likely 
that people made and used tools of stone,  
wood and bone, of which stone tools have  
survived best.
Some of these stone tools were used to cut 
meat and bone, scrape bark (from trees) and 
hides (animal skins), chop fruit and roots. Some 
may have been attached to handles of bone or 
wood, to make spears and arrows for hunting. 
Other tools were used to chop wood, which was  
used as firewood. Wood was also used to make 
huts and tools.  
Stone tools may also  
have been used for :

light, to roast meat, and to scare away animals. 
What do we use fire for today? 
Names and dates
Archaeologists have given lengthy names for the time that we are studying. 
They call the earliest period the Palaeolithic. This comes from two Greek 
words, ‘palaeo’, meaning old, and ‘lithos’, meaning stone. The name points 
to the importance of finds of stone tools. The Palaeolithic period extends 
from 2 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago. This long stretch of time 
is divided into the Lower, Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. This long span of 
time covers 99 per cent of human history. 
The period when we find environmental changes, beginning about 12,000 
years ago till about 10,000 years ago is called the Mesolithic (middle stone). 
Stone tools found during this period are generally tiny, and are called 
microliths. Microliths were probably stuck on to handles of bone or wood 
to make tools such as saws and sickles. At the same time, older varieties 
of tools continued to be in use.
The next stage, from about 10,000 years ago, is known as the Neolithic.   
What do you think the term Neolithic means?
We have also mentioned the names of some places. You will find the 
names of many more places in later chapters. Very often, we use present-
day names of the places where people lived in the past, because we do not 
know what they called them.
Rationalised 2023-24
15 
from hunting–gathering 
to growing food
A changing environment 
Around 12,000 years ago, there were major 
changes in the climate of the world, with a shift 
to relatively warm conditions. In many areas, this 
led to the development of grasslands. This in turn 
led to an increase in the number of deer, antelope, 
goat, sheep and cattle, i.e. animals that survived 
on grass. 
Those who hunted these animals now followed 
them, learning about their food habits and their 
breeding seasons. It is likely that this helped 
people to start thinking about herding and rearing 
these animals themselves. Fishing also became 
important.
The beginning of farming and herding
This was also a time when several grain bearing 
grasses, including wheat, barley and rice grew 
naturally in different parts of the subcontinent. 
Men, women and children probably collected these 
grains as food, and learnt where they grew, and 
when they ripened. This may have led them to 
think about growing plants on their own. In this 
way people became farmers. 
People could also attract and then tame animals 
by leaving food for them near their shelters. The 
first animal to be tamed was the wild ancestor of 
the dog. Later, people encouraged animals that 
were relatively gentle to come near the camps 
where they lived. These animals such as sheep, 
goat, cattle and also the pig lived in herds, and 
most of them ate grass. Often, people protected 
these animals from attacks by other wild animals. 
This is how they became herders. 
Can you think of any reasons why the dog was 
perhaps the first animal to be tamed?
Rationalised 2023-24
 
Domestication
is the name given to the process in which people grow plants and look 
after animals. Very often, plants and animals that are tended by people 
become different from wild plants and animals. This is because people 
select plants and animals for domestication. For example, they select those 
plants and animals that are not prone to disease. They also select plants 
that yield large-size grain, and have strong stalks, capable of bearing 
the weight of the ripe grain. 
Seeds from selected plants are 
preserved and sown to ensure 
that new plants (and seeds) will 
have the same qualities.  
Amongst animals, those 
that are relatively gentle are 
selected for breeding. As a 
result, gradually, domesticated 
animals and plants become 
different from wild animals and 
plants. For example, the teeth and horns of wild animals are usually 
much larger than those of domesticated animals. 
Look at these two sets of teeth. Which do you think belongs to a wild 
pig and which to a domesticated one?
Domestication was a gradual process that took place in many parts of 
the world. It began about 12,000 years ago. Virtually all the plants and 
animals produce that we use as food today is a result of domestication. 
Some of the earliest plants to be domesticated were wheat and barley. 
The earliest domesticated animals include sheep and goat.
A new way of life
If you plant a seed, you will notice that it takes 
some time to grow. This may be for several days, 
weeks, months and in some cases years. When 
people began growing plants, it meant that they 
had to stay in the same place for a long time 
looking after the plants, watering, weeding, 
driving away animals and birds — till the  
grain ripened.  And then, the grain had to be used 
carefully.

As grain had to be stored for both food and seed,

areas, they began making large clay pots, or wove 
baskets, or dug pits into the ground. Do you think 
hunter-gatherers would have made and used pots? 
Give reasons for your answer. 
Rearing animals
Animals multiply naturally. Besides, if they are 
looked after carefully, they provide milk, which is 
an important source of food, and meat, whenever 
required. In other words, animals that are reared 
can be used as a ‘store’ of food.  
Apart from food, what are the other things that 
could have been obtained from animals?
What are animals used for today?  
Finding out about the first farmers and herders
Turn to Map 2 (page12). You will notice a number 
of blue squares. Each marks a site from where 
archaeologists have found evidence of early 
farmers and herders. These are found all over the 
subcontinent. Some of the most important ones are 
in the north-west, in present-day Kashmir, and in 
east and south India. 
To find out whether these sites were settlements 
of farmers and herders, scientists study evidence 
of plants and animal bones. One of the most 
exciting finds includes remains of burnt grain. 
(These may have been burnt accidentally or on 
purpose). Scientists can identify these grains, and 
so we know that a number of crops were grown in 
different parts of the subcontinent. They can also 
identify the bones of different animals.

Towards a settled life
Archaeologists have found traces of huts or 
houses at some sites. For instance, in Burzahom  
(in present-day Kashmir) people built pit-houses, 
which were dug into the ground, with steps leading 
into them. These may have provided shelter in cold 
weather. Archaeologists have also found cooking 
hearths both inside and outside the huts, which 
suggests that, depending on the weather, people 
could cook food either indoors or outdoors.  
Stone tools have been found from many sites as 
well. Many of these are different from the earlier 
Palaeolithic tools and that is why they are called 
Neolithic. These include tools that were polished to 
give a fine cutting edge, and mortars and pestles 
used for grinding grain and other plant produce. 
Mortars and pestles are used for grinding grain 
even today, several thousand years later. At the 
same time, tools of the Palaeolithic types continued 
to be made and used, and remember, some tools 
were also made of bone.
Many kinds of earthen pots have also been 
found. These were sometimes decorated, and were 
used for storing things. People began using pots 
for cooking food, especially grains like rice, wheat 
and lentils that now became an important part

using different kinds of materials, for example

 Did things change everywhere and all at 
once? Not quite. In many areas, men and women 
still continued to hunt and gather food, and 
elsewhere people adopted farming and herding 
slowly, over several thousand years. Besides, 
in some cases people tried to combine these 
activities, doing different things during different 
seasons.

this site many animal bones were found. Bones of 
wild animals such as the deer and pig, and also 
bones of sheep and goat were found.

The story of Harappa
Very often, old buildings have a story to tell. Nearly 
a hundred and fifty years ago, when railway lines 
were being laid down for the first time in Punjab, 
engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in 
present-day Pakistan. To them, it seemed like a 
mound that was a rich source of ready made, high 
quality bricks. So they carried off thousands of 
bricks from the walls of the old buildings of the 
city to build railway lines. Many buildings were 
completely destroyed. 
Then, about eighty years ago, archaeologists 
found the site, and realised that this was one of 
the oldest cities in the subcontinent. As this was 
the first city to be discovered, all other sites from 
where similar buildings (and other things) were 
found were described as Harappan. These cities 
developed about 4700 years ago. 
Very often, old buildings are pulled down to 
make way for new construction. Do you think it is 
important to preserve old buildings?
CHAPTER 3 
IN THE EARLIEST CITIES
Saving an old building 
Jaspal and Harpreet were playing cricket in the lane 
outside their home when they noticed the people who 
were admiring the dilapidated old building that the 
children called the haunted house. 
“Look at the architecture!” said one of the men.
“Have you seen the fine wood carving?” asked one of 
the women. 
“We must write to the Minister so that she makes 
arrangements to repair and preserve this beautiful 
house.” Why, they wondered, would anybody be 
interested in the old, run down house?

The Earliest Cities 
in the Subcontinent 
What was special about these cities? 
Many of these cities were divided into two or more 
parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller 
but higher. Archaeologists describe this as the 
citadel. Generally, the part to the east was larger 
but lower. This is called the lower town. Very 
often walls of baked brick were built around each 
part. The bricks were so well baked that they have 
lasted for thousands of years. The bricks were 
laid in an interlocking pattern and that made the  
walls strong. 
These cities were found 
in Punjab and Sind in 
Pakistan, and in Gujarat, 
Rajasthan, Haryana 
and Punjab in India. 
Archaeologists have found 
a set of unique objects 
in almost all these cities: 
red pottery painted with 
designs in black, stone 
weights, seals, special 
beads, copper tools, and 
paralleled sided long stone 
blades. 
In some cities, special 
buildings were constructed 
on the citadel. For example, in 
Mohenjodaro, a very special 
tank, which archaeologists 
call the Great Bath, was built 
in this area. This was lined 
with bricks, coated with 
plaster, and made water-
tight with a layer of natural 
tar. There were steps leading 
down to it from two sides, 
while there were rooms on 
all sides. Water was probably 
brought in from a well, 
and drained out after use. 
Perhaps important people 
took a dip in this tank on 
special occasions. 
Other cities, such as 
Kalibangan and Lothal 
had  fire altars, where 
sacrifices may have been 
performed. And some cities 
like Mohenjodaro, Harappa, 
and Lothal had elaborate 
storehouses. 
Rationalised 2023-24
Houses, drains and streets
Generally, houses were either one or two storeys 
high, with rooms built around a courtyard. Most 
houses had a separate bathing area, and some had 
wells to supply water.
Many of these cities had covered 
drains. Notice how carefully these 
were laid out, in straight lines. 
Although you cannot see it, each 
drain had a gentle slope so that water 
could flow through it. Very often, 
drains in houses were connected 
to those on the streets and smaller 
drains led into bigger ones. As the 
drains were covered, inspection 
holes were provided at intervals to 
clean them. All three — houses, 
drains and streets — were probably 
planned and built at the same time.

and those that you studied about in

Life in the city
A Harappan city was a very busy place. 
There were people who planned the 
construction of special buildings in the 
city. These were probably the rulers. It 
is likely that the rulers sent people to 
distant lands to get metal, precious stones, 
and other things that they wanted. They 
may have kept the most valuable objects, 
such as ornaments of gold and silver, or 
beautiful beads, for themselves. And there 
were scribes, people who knew how to 
write, who helped prepare the seals, and 
perhaps wrote on other materials that have 
not survived. 
Besides, there were men and women, 
craftspersons, making all kinds of things 
— either in their own homes, or in special 
workshops. People were travelling to distant 
lands or returning with raw materials and, 
perhaps, stories. Many terracotta toys have 
been found and children must have played 
with these.

New crafts in the city
Let us look at some of the objects that were made 
and found in Harappan cities. Most of the things 
that have been found by archaeologists are made 
of stone, shell and metal, including copper, bronze, 
gold and silver. Copper and bronze were used to 
make tools, weapons, ornaments and vessels. 
Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and 
vessels.
Perhaps the most striking finds are those of 
beads, weights, and blades. 
Top : Stone weights. 
Notice how carefully and 
precisely these weights are 
shaped. These were made 
of chert, a kind of stone. 
These were probably used 
to weigh precious stones 
or metals.
Right : Beads.             
Many of these were 
made out of carnelian, a 
beautiful red stone. The 
stone was cut, shaped, 
polished and finally a hole 
was bored through the 
centre so that a string 
could be passed through it. 
Far right : Stone blades.
Bottom Right : 
Embroidered cloth.         
A stone statue of an 
important man found from 
Mohenjodaro shows him 
wearing an embroidered

The Harappans also made seals out of stone. 
These are generally rectangular (See illustration 
on page 25) and usually have an animal carved 
on them.
The Harappans also made pots with beautiful 
black designs, such as the one 
shown on page 6.
Was metal used in the villages 
you learnt about in Chapter 2?
Was stone used to make 
weights?
Cotton was probably grown 
at Mehrgarh from about 7000 
years ago. Actual pieces of 
cloth were found attached 
to the lid of a silver vase 
and some copper objects at 
Mohenjodaro. Archaeologists 
have also found spindle whorls, 
Rationalised 2023-24

Faience
Unlike stone or shell, that are found naturally, 
faience is a material that is artificially produced. A 
gum was used to shape sand or powdered quartz into 
an object. The objects were then glazed, resulting in 
a shiny, glassy surface. The colours of the glaze were 
usually blue or sea green.
Faience was used to make beads, bangles, 
earrings, and tiny vessels.
made of terracotta and faience. These were used 
to spin thread. 
Many of the things that were produced were 
probably the work of specialists. A specialist is a 
person who is trained to do only one kind of work, 
for example, cutting stone, or polishing beads, or 
carving seals. Look at the illustration (page 26) and 
see how well the face is carved and how carefully 
the beard is shown. This must have been the work 
of an expert craftsperson. 
Not everybody could have been a specialist. We 
do not know whether only men were specialists or 
only women were specialists. Perhaps some women 
and men may have been specialists. 
In search of raw materials
Raw materials are substances that are either 
found naturally (such as wood, or ores of metals) 
or produced by farmers or herders. These are then 
processed to produce finished goods. For example, 
cotton, produced by farmers, is a raw material that 
may be processed to make cloth. While some of 
the raw materials that the Harappans used were 
available locally, many items such as copper, tin, 
gold, silver and precious stones had to be brought 
from distant places. 
The Harappans probably got copper from 
present-day Rajasthan, and even from Oman in

West Asia. Tin, which was mixed with 
copper to produce bronze, may have been 
brought from present-day Afghanistan 
and Iran. Gold could have come all 
the way from present-day Karnataka, 
and precious stones from present-day 
Gujarat, Iran and Afghanistan.
How were goods carried 
from one place to 
another?
Look at the illustrations. 
One shows a toy and the 
other is a seal. 
Can you suggest what the 
modes of transport used 
by the Harappans were?       
Did you come across 
illustrations of wheeled 
vehicles in earlier lessons?
A toy plough.
Today, in many farming 
communities, only men 
use the plough. We do 
not know whether the 
Harappans followed such 
customs or not.  
Food for people in the cities
While many people lived in the cities, others living 
in the countryside grew crops and reared animals. 
These farmers and herders supplied food to 
craftspersons, scribes and rulers in the cities. We 
know from remains of plants that the Harappans 
grew wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, 
linseed and mustard. 
A new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth 
for turning the soil and planting seeds. While real 
ploughs, which were probably made of wood, have 
not survived, toy models have been found. As this 
region does not receive heavy rainfall, some form 
of irrigation may have been used. This means that 
water was stored and supplied to 
the fields when the plants were 
growing. 
The Harappans reared cattle, sheep, 
goat and buffalo. Water and pastures were available 
around settlements. However, in the dry summer 
months, large herds of animals were probably 
taken to greater distances in search of grass and 
water. They also collected fruits like ber, caught 
fish and hunted wild animals like the antelope.

A closer look — Harappan towns in Gujarat
The city of Dholavira was located on Khadir Beyt 
(also spelled as Bet) in the Rann of Kutch, where 
there was fresh water and fertile soil. Unlike some 
of the other Harappan cities, which were divided 
into two parts, Dholavira was divided into three 
parts, and each part was surrounded with massive 
stone walls, with entrances through gateways. 
There was also a large open area in the settlement, 
where public ceremonies could be held. Other 
finds include large letters of the Harappan script 
that were carved out of white stone and perhaps 
inlaid in wood. This is a unique find as generally 
Harappan writing has been found on small objects 
such as seals. 
The city of Lothal stood beside a tributary of 
the Sabarmati, in Gujarat, close to the Gulf of 
Khambat. It was situated near areas where raw 
materials such as semi-precious stones were 
easily available. This was an important centre for 
making objects out of stone, shell and metal. There 
was also a storehouse in the city. Many seals and 
sealings (the impression of seals on clay) were 
found in this storehouse. 
A dockyard at Lothal.
This huge tank may have 
been a dockyard, where 
boats and ships came in

Seals and sealings
Seals may have been used to stamp bags or packets 
containing goods that were sent from one place to 
another. After a bag was closed or tied, a layer of 
wet clay was applied on the knot, and the seal was 
pressed on it. The impression of the seal is known 
as a sealing.
If the sealing was intact, one could be sure that 
the goods had arrived safely.
Seals are used even today. Find out what they are 
used for.  
The mystery of the end
Around 3900 years ago, we find the beginning of a 
major change. People stopped living in many of the 
cities. Writing, seals and weights were no longer 
used. Raw materials brought from long distances 
became rare. In Mohenjodaro, we find that garbage 
piled up on the streets, the drainage system broke 
down, and new, less impressive houses were built, 
even over the streets. 
Why did all this happen? We are not sure. 
Some scholars suggest that the rivers dried up. 
Others suggest that there was deforestation. This 
could have happened because fuel was required 
for baking bricks, and for smelting copper ores. 
Besides, grazing by large herds of cattle, sheep and 
goat may have destroyed the green cover. In some 
areas there were floods. But none of these reasons 
can explain the end of all the cities. Flooding, or 
a river drying up would have had an effect in only 
some areas.

One of the oldest literary sources in the world
You may have heard about the Vedas. There are 
four of them – the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda 
and Atharvaveda.  The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, 
composed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda 
includes more than a thousand hymns, called 
sukta or “well-said”. These hymns are in praise 
of various gods and goddesses. Three gods are 
especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, 
a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a 
special drink was prepared.
These hymns were composed by sages (rishis). 
Priests taught students to recite and memorise 
each syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with 
great care. Most of the hymns were composed, 
taught and learnt by men. A few were composed 
by women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, 
which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in 
school these days.

so many shelves, all full of books. In one corner was a 
cupboard filled with large, old volumes. Seeing her trying 
to open the cupboard, the teacher said, “That cupboard 
has very special books on different religions. Did you know 
that we have a set of the Vedas?”

Sanskrit and other languages
Sanskrit is a part of family of languages known as Indo-European. 
Some Indian languages such as Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri and 
Sindhi; Asian languages such as Persian and many European languages 
such as English, French, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish belong to 
this family. They are called a family because they originally had words 
in common.  
Take the words ‘matr’ (Sanskrit), ‘ma’ (Hindi) and ‘mother’ (English). 
Do you notice any similarities? 
Other languages used in the subcontinent belong to different families. 
For instance, those used in the north-east belong to the Tibeto-Burman 
family; Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam belong to the Dravidian 
family; and the languages spoken in Jharkhand and parts of central 
India belong to the Austro-Asiatic family. 
List the languages you have heard about and try and identify the 
families to which they belong.
The books we use are written and printed. The 
Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read.  
It was written down several centuries after it 
was first composed, and printed less than 200  
years ago.  
How historians study the Rigveda 
Historians, like archaeologists, find out about the 
past, but, in addition to material remains, they 
examine written sources as well. Let us see how 
they study the Rigveda.
Some of the hymns in the Rigveda are in the 
form of dialogues. This is part of one such hymn, a 
dialogue between a sage named Vishvamitra, and 
two rivers, (Beas and Sutlej) that were worshipped 
as goddesses.

A page from a manuscript 
of the Rigveda.
This manuscript of the 
Rigveda, on birch bark, was 
found in Kashmir. About 
150 years ago, it was used 
to prepare one of the 
earliest printed texts of 
the Rigveda, as well as an 
English translation. It is 
now preserved in a library 
in Pune, Maharashtra.
Vishvamitra and the Rivers 
Vishvamitra: O rivers, come down from the mountains like two swift horses, 
like two shining cows that lick their calves. 
You move like chariots to the sea, through the power of Indra. You are full of 
water and wish to unite with one another. 
The rivers: We, who are full of water, move along the path the gods have made 
for us. Once we start flowing, we cannot be stopped. Why do you pray to us, o 
sage? 
Vishvamitra: O sisters, please listen to me, the singer who has come from a 
distance with his chariots and carts. Let your waters not rise above our axles, so 
that we can cross safely. 
The rivers:  We will listen to your prayers so that you can cross safely.
Historians point out that this hymn was composed in the area where 
these rivers flow. They also suggest that the sage lived in a society where 
horses and cows were valued animals. That is why the rivers are compared 
to horses and cows.  
Do you think chariots were also important? Give reasons for your answer. 
Read the verses and find out what are the modes of transport that are 
mentioned.  
Other rivers, especially the Indus and its other tributaries, and the 
Sarasvati, are also named in the hymns.  The Ganga and Yamuna are 
named only once.

Rigveda.

Cattle, horses and chariots
There are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle, 
children (especially sons), and horses. Horses were 
yoked to chariots that were used in battles, which 
were fought to capture cattle. Battles were also 
fought for land, which was important for pasture, 
and for growing hardy crops that ripened quickly, 
such as barley.  Some battles were fought for water, 
and to capture people. 
Some of the wealth that was obtained was kept 
by the leaders, some was given to the priests and 
the rest was distributed amongst the people. Some 
wealth was used for the performance of yajnas or 
sacrifices in which offerings were made into the 
fire. These were meant for gods and goddesses. 
Offerings could include ghee, grain, and in some 
cases, animals. 
Most men took part in these wars. There was 
no regular army, but there were assemblies where 
people met and discussed matters of war and 
peace. They also chose leaders, who were often 
brave and skilful warriors. 
Words to describe people
There are several ways of describing people — 
in terms of the work they do, the language they 
speak, the place they belong to, their family, their 
communities and cultural practices. Let us see 
some of the words used to describe people found 
in the Rigveda.
There are two groups who are described in  
terms of their work — the priests, sometimes  
called brahmins, who performed various rituals, 
and the rajas. 
These rajas were not like the ones you will be 
learning about later. They did not have capital 
cities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes. 
Rationalised 2023-24
37 
what books and  
burials tell us
Generally, sons did not automatically succeed 
fathers as rajas. 
Read the previous section once more and see 
whether you can find out what the rajas did. 
Two words were used to describe the people or 
the community as a whole. One was the word jana, 
which we still use in Hindi and other languages. 
The other was vish. The word vaishya comes from 
vish. You will learn more about this in Chapter 5. 
Several vish or jana are mentioned by name. 
So we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the 
Bharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and 
so on. 
Do any of these names sound familiar? 
Sometimes, the people who composed the hymns 
described themselves as Aryas and called their 
opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were people 
who did not perform sacrifices, and probably spoke 
different languages. Later, the term dasa (and the 
feminine dasi) came to mean slave. Slaves were 
women and men who were often captured in war. 
They were treated as the property of their owners, 
who could make them do whatever work they 
wanted. 
While the Rigveda was being composed in the 
north-west of the subcontinent, there were other 
developments elsewhere. Let us look at some of 
these. 
Silent sentinels—the story of the megaliths
Look at the illustration on the next page.
These stone boulders are known as megaliths 
(literally big stones). These were carefully arranged 
by people, and were used to mark burial sites. 
The practice of erecting megaliths began about  
3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout  
the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and 
Kashmir. 
Rationalised 2023-24
Some important megalithic 
sites are shown on Map 2  
(page 12). While some megaliths 
can be seen on the surface, 
other megalithic burials are 
often underground. 
Sometimes, archaeologists 
find a circle of stone boulders 
or a single large stone standing 
on the ground. These are the 
only indications that there are 
burials beneath. 
There were several things that people did to 
make megaliths. We have made a list here. Try and 
arrange them in the correct order: digging pits in 
the earth, transporting stones, breaking boulders, 
placing stones in position, finding suitable stone, 
shaping stones, burying the dead.
All these burials have some common features. 
Generally, the dead were buried with distinctive 
pots, which are called Black and Red Ware. 
Also found are tools and weapons of iron and 
sometimes, skeletons of horses, horse equipment 
and ornaments of stone and gold.
Was iron used in the Harappan cities?

Finding out about social differences
Archaeologists think that objects found with a 
skeleton probably belonged to the dead person. 
Sometimes, more objects are found in one grave 
than in another. Find Brahmagiri on Map 2  
(page 12). Here, one skeleton was buried with 33 
gold beads, 2 stone beads, 4 copper bangles, and 
one conch shell. Other skeletons have only a few 
pots. These finds suggest that there was some 
difference in status amongst the people who were 
buried.  Some were rich, others poor, some chiefs, 
others followers.
Were some burial spots meant for certain families?
Sometimes, megaliths contain more than one 
skeleton. These indicate that people, perhaps 
belonging to the same family, were buried in the 
same place though not at the same time. The bodies 
of those who died later were brought into the grave 
through the portholes. Stone circles or boulders

the river Ghod, a tributary of the Bhima. It was 
occupied between 3600 and 2700 years ago. Here, 
adults were generally buried in the ground, laid 
out straight, with the head towards the north. 
Sometimes burials were within the houses. Vessels 
that probably contained food and water were placed 
with the dead.
One man was found buried in a large, four legged 
clay jar in the courtyard of a five-roomed house

What skeletal studies tell us
It is easy to make out the skeleton of a child from its small size. 
However, there are no major differences in the bones of a girl and a boy.
Can we make out whether a skeleton was that of a man or a woman?
Sometimes, people decide on the basis of what is found with the 
skeleton. For instance, if a skeleton is found with jewellery, it is 
sometimes thought to be that of a woman.  However, there are problems 
with this. Often, men also wore ornaments.
A better way of figuring out the sex of a skeleton is to look at the 
bone structure. The hip or the pelvic area of women is generally larger 
to enable child bearing.   
These distinctions are based on modern skeletal studies. 
About 2000 years ago, there was a famous physician named Charaka 
who wrote a book on medicine known as the Charaka Samhita. There 
he states that the human body has 360 bones. This is a much larger 
number than the 200 bones that are recognised in modern anatomy. 
Charaka arrived at this figure by counting the teeth, joints and cartilage. 
How do you think he found out about the human body in such  
great detail?
Do you think this was the body of a chief? Give

How some men became rulers
Choosing leaders or rulers by voting is something 
that has become common during the last fifty 
years or so. How did men become rulers in the 
past? Around 3000 years ago, some men became 
recognised as rajas by performing big sacrifices. 
The ashvamedha or horse sacrifice was one 
such ritual. A horse was let loose to wander freely 
and it was guarded by the raja’s men. If the horse 
wandered into the kingdoms of other rajas and 
they stopped it, they had to fight. If they allowed 
the horse to pass, it meant that they accepted that 
the raja who wanted to perform the sacrifice was 
stronger than them. These rajas were then invited 
to the sacrifice, which was performed by specially 
trained priests, who were rewarded with gifts. The 
raja who organised the sacrifice was recognised 
as being very powerful, and all those who came 
brought gifts for him.  
The raja was a central figure in these rituals. 
He often had a special seat, a throne or a tiger 
skin. His charioteer, who was his companion in 
the battlefield and witnessed his exploits, chanted 
tales of his glory. His relatives, especially his wives 
and sons, had to perform a variety of minor rituals.

Painted Grey Ware.
Plates and bowls are the 
most common vessels made 
out of Painted Grey Ware. 
These are extremely fine to 
touch, with a nice, smooth 
surface. Perhaps these were 
used on special occasions, 
for important people, and to 
serve special food.  
The other rajas were simply spectators who had 
to sit and watch the performance of the sacrifice. 
Priests performed the rituals including the 
sprinkling of sacred water on the king. The ordinary 
people, the vish or vaishya, also brought gifts. 
However, some people, such as those who were 
regarded as shudras by the priests, were excluded 
from many rituals. 
Make a list of all those who would be present 
at the sacrifice. Which are the categories that are 
described in terms of their occupation? 
Varnas
There were four social categories, namely Brahmins, Kshatriyas, 
Vaishyas and Shudras. Brahmins were expected to study (and teach) 
the Vedas, perform sacrifices and receive gifts. 
Kshatriyas were expected to fight battles and protect people. 
Vaishyas were expected to be farmers, herders, and traders. 
The Shudras were expected to serve the other three groups.
Janapadas
The rajas who performed these big sacrifices 
were now recognised as being rajas of janapadas 
rather than janas. The word janapada literally 
means the land where the jana set its foot, and 
settled down. Some important janapadas are 
shown on Map 4 (page 45).
Archaeologists have excavated a number 
of settlements in these janapadas, such 
as Purana Qila in Delhi, Hastinapura near 
Meerut, and Atranjikhera, near Etah (the 
last two are in Uttar Pradesh). They found 
that people lived in huts, and kept cattle 
as well as other animals. They also grew 
a variety of crops — rice, wheat, barley, 
pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard.  
Is there a crop in this list that was not

grey in colour, others were red. One special type 
of pottery found at these sites is known as Painted 
Grey Ware. As is obvious from the name, these grey 
pots had painted designs, usually simple lines and 
geometric patterns. 
Mahajanapadas
About 2500 years ago, some janapadas became 
more important than others, and were known as 
mahajanapadas. Some of these are shown on Map 
4. Most mahajanapadas had a capital city, many 
of these were fortified. This means that huge walls 
of wood, brick or stone were built around them.
Forts were probably built because people were 
afraid of attacks from other kings and needed

protection. It is also likely that some rulers 
wanted to show how rich and powerful they were 
by building really large, tall and impressive walls 
around their cities. Also in this way, the land and 
the people living inside the fortified area could 
be controlled more easily by the king. Building 
such huge walls required a great deal of planning. 
Thousands, if not lakhs of bricks or stones had to 
be prepared. This in turn meant enormous labour, 
provided, possibly, by thousands of men, women 
and children. And resources had to be found for 
all of this.

The new rajas now began maintaining armies. 
Soldiers were paid regular salaries and maintained 
by the king throughout the year. Some payments 
were probably made using punch marked coins 
(see the illustration on page 75). You will read more 
about these coins in Chapter 8.  
List two ways in which the rajas of the 
mahajanapadas were different from those 
mentioned in the Rigveda. 
Taxes
As the rulers of the mahajanapadas were  
(a) building huge forts (b) maintaining big armies, 
they needed more resources. And they needed 
officials to collect these. So, instead of depending 
on occasional gifts brought by people, as in the case 
of the raja of the janapadas, they started collecting 
regular taxes.
• Taxes on crops 
• Taxes on craftspersons 
• Herders paid taxes as animals and animal produce. 
• Taxes on goods through trade.
• Hunters and gatherers had to provide forest produce 
to the raja. 
 What do you think would have been provided 
by hunters and gatherers?
Changes in agriculture
There were two major changes in agriculture 
around this time. One was the growing use of 
iron ploughshares. This meant that heavy, clayey 
soil could be turned over better than with a 
wooden ploughshare, so that more grain could 
be produced. Second, people began transplanting

our pasts–i
paddy. This meant that instead of scattering seed 
on the ground, from which plants would sprout, 
saplings were grown and then planted in the fields. 
This led to increased production, as many more 
plants survived. 
Can you think why kings would encourage these 
changes? 
A closer look — (a) Magadha  
Find Magadha on Map 4 (page 45). Magadha 
became the most important mahajanapada in 
about two hundred years. Many rivers such as 
the Ganga and Son flowed through Magadha. This 
was important for (a) transport, (b) water supplies 
(c) making the land fertile. Parts of Magadha were 
forested. Elephants, which lived in the forest, could 
be captured and trained for the army. Forests 
also provided wood for building houses, carts and 
chariots. Besides, there were iron ore mines in the 
region that could be tapped to make strong tools 
and weapons.
Magadha had two very powerful rulers, Bimbisara 
and Ajatasattu, who used all possible means to 
conquer other janapadas. Mahapadma Nanda was 
another important ruler. He extended his control 
up to the north-west part of the subcontinent. 
Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) in Bihar was the 
capital of Magadha for several years. Later the 
capital was shifted to Pataliputra (present-day 
Patna).
More than 2300 years ago, a ruler named 
Alexander, who lived in Macedonia in Europe, 
wanted to become a world conqueror. Of course, 
he didn’t conquer the world, but did conquer parts 
of Egypt and West Asia, and came to the Indian 
subcontinent, reaching up to the banks of the 
Beas. When he wanted to march further eastwards, 
his soldiers refused. They were scared, as they had

heard that the rulers of India had vast armies of 
foot soldiers, chariots and elephants.
In what ways were these armies different from 
those described in the Rigveda? 
A closer look — (b) Vajji
While Magadha became a powerful kingdom, Vajji, 
with its capital at Vaishali (Bihar), was under a 
different form of government, known as gana or 
sangha. 
In a gana or a sangha there were not one, but 
many rulers and each one was known as a raja. 
These rajas performed rituals together. They also 
met in assemblies, and decided what had to be 
done and how, through discussion and debate. For 
example, if they were attacked by an enemy, they 
met to discuss what should be done to meet the 
threat. However, women, dasas and kammakaras 
could not participate in these assemblies. 
This is an account of the Vajjis from the Digha 
Nikaya, a famous Buddhist book, which contains 
some of the speeches of the Buddha. These were 
written down about 2300 years ago.
Ajatasattu and the Vajjis
Ajatasattu wanted to attack the Vajjis. He sent his 
minister named Vassakara to the Buddha to get his 
advice on the matter. 
The Buddha asked whether the Vajjis met 
frequently, in full assemblies. When he heard that 
they did, he replied that the Vajjis would continue 
to prosper as long as:
• They held full and frequent public assemblies. 
• They met and acted together. 
• They followed established rules. 
• They respected, supported and listened to elders.

This was the first time Anagha was going on a school trip. 
They boarded the train from Pune (in Maharashtra) late

take them to see Sarnath as well.”
The story of the Buddha
Siddhartha, also known as Gautama, the founder 
of Buddhism, was born about 2500 years ago. 
This was a time of rapid change in the lives of 
people. As you saw in Chapter 5, some kings in 
the mahajanapadas were growing more powerful. 
New cities were developing, and life was changing 
in the villages as well. Many thinkers were trying 
to understand these changes in society. They also 
wanted to try and find out the true meaning of life. 
The Buddha belonged to a small gana known as 
the Sakya gana, and was a kshatriya. When he 
was a young man, he left the comforts of his home 
in search of knowledge. He wandered for several 
years, meeting and holding discussions with other 
thinkers. He finally decided to find his own path to 
realisation, and meditated for days on end under 
a peepal tree at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, where he 
attained enlightenment. After that, he was known 
as the Buddha or the Wise One. He then went to 
Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he taught for the 
first time. He spent the rest of his life travelling on 
foot, going from place to place, teaching people, till 
he passed away at Kusinara.

new questions  
and ideas
The Buddha taught that life is full of suffering 
and unhappiness. This is caused because we 
have cravings and desires (which often cannot 
be fulfilled). Sometimes, even if we get what we 
want, we are not satisfied, and want even more 
(or want other things). The Buddha described this 
as thirst or tanha. He taught that this constant 
craving could be removed by following moderation 
in everything. 
He also taught people to be kind, and to respect 
the lives of others, including animals. He believed 
that the results of our actions (called karma), 
whether good or bad, affect us 
both in this life and the 
next.  The Buddha taught 
in the language of  the 
ordinary people, Prakrit, 
so that everybody could 
understand his message. 
What was the language 
used to compose the 
Vedas? 
He also encouraged 
people to think for 
themselves rather 
than to simply 
accept what he 
said. Let us see 
how he did this.

Once there was a woman named Kisagotami, whose son had died. She 
was so sad that she roamed through the streets of the city carrying the 
child with her, asking for help to bring him back to life. A kind man took 
her to the Buddha.
The Buddha said: “Bring me a handful of mustard seeds, and I will bring 
your child back to life.”
Kisagotami was overjoyed and started off at once, but the Buddha gently 
stopped her and added: “The seeds must come from the house of a family 
where nobody has died.”
Kisagotami went from door to door, but wherever she went, she found 
out that someone or the other — father, mother, sister, brother, husband, 
wife, child, uncle, aunt, grandfather, grandmother — had died. 
What was the Buddha trying to teach the sorrowing mother?
Upanishads
Around the time, various other 
thinkers also tried to find answers 
to philosophical questions. Some 
of them wanted to know about 
life after death, others wanted 
to know why sacrifices should 
be performed. Many of these 
thinkers felt that there was 
something permanent in the 
universe that would last even 
after death. They described this 
as the atman or the individual 
soul and the brahman or the 
universal soul. They believed that 
ultimately, both the atman and 
the brahman were one. 
Many of their ideas were 
recorded in the Upanishads. 
These were part of the later 
Vedic texts. Upanishad literally

Six Schools of Indian Philosophy
Over centuries, India’s intellectual 
exploration of truth has come to 
be represented by six systems of 
philosophy. These are known as 
Vaishesika, Nyaya, Samkhya, Yoga, 
Purva Mimansa and Vedanta or 
Uttara Mimansa. These six systems 
of philosophy are said to have been 
founded by sages Konada, Gotama, 
Kapila, Patanjali, Jaimini and Vyasa, 
respectively. These philosophies 
still guide scholarly discourse in 
the country. German-born British 
indologist, Friedrich Max Muller, 
has observed that the six systems of 
philosophy were developed over many 
generations with contributions made 
by individual thinkers. However, 
today, we find an underlying harmony 
in their understanding of truth, 
although they seem distinct from

near’ and the texts contain conversations between 
teachers and students. Often, ideas were presented 
through simple dialogues. 
Most Upanishadic thinkers were men, especially 
brahmins and rajas. Occasionally, there is mention 
of women thinkers, such as Gargi, Apala, Ghosha, 
and Maitreyi, who were famous for their learning, 
and participated in debates. Poor people rarely took 
part in these discussions. One famous exception 
was Satyakama Jabala, who was named after his 
mother, the slave woman Jabali. He had a deep 
desire to learn about reality, was accepted as a 
student by a brahmin teacher named Gautama, 
and became one of the best-known thinkers of the 
time. Many of the ideas of the Upanishads were later 
developed by the famous thinker Shankaracharya, 
about whom you will read in Class VII. 
The wise beggar
Here is a dialogue based on a story from one of the most famous 
Upanishads, the Chhandogya Upanishad.
Shaunaka and Abhipratarin were two sages who worshipped the 
universal soul. 
Once, as they sat down to eat, a beggar came and asked for some food.
“We cannot spare anything for you,” Shaunaka said.
“Learned sirs, whom do you worship?” the beggar asked.
“The universal soul,” Abhipratarin replied. 
“Ah! It means that you know that the universal soul fills the entire world.”
“Yes, yes. We know that.” The sages nodded. 
“If the universal soul fills the whole world, it fills me too. Who am I, but 
a part of the world?” the beggar asked. 
“You speak the truth, O young brahmin.”
“Then, O sages, by not giving me food, you are actually denying food 
to the universal soul.”
The sages realised the truth of what the beggar said, and shared their 
food with him. 
How did the beggar convince the sages to share their food with him?

Panini, the grammarian
This was also the time when other scholars were 
at work. One of the most famous was Panini, who 
prepared a grammar for Sanskrit. He arranged the 
vowels and the consonants in a special order, and 
then used these to create formulae like those found in 
Algebra.  He used these to write down the rules of the 
language in short formulae (around 3000 of them!).
Jainism
The last and 24th tirthankara of the Jainas, 
Vardhamana Mahavira, also spread his message 
around this time, i.e. 2500 years ago. He was a 
kshatriya prince of the Lichchhavis, a group that 
was a part of the Vajji sangha, about which you 
read in Chapter 5. At the age of thirty, he left home 
and went to live in a forest. For twelve years, he 
led a hard and lonely life, at the end of which he 
attained enlightenment. 
He taught a simple doctrine: men and women 
who wished to know the truth must leave their 
homes. They must follow very strictly the  rules of 
ahimsa, which means not hurting or killing living 
beings. “All beings,” said Mahavira “long to live. 
To all things life is dear.” Ordinary people could 
understand the teachings of Mahavira and his 
followers, because they used Prakrit. There were 
several forms of Prakrit, used in different parts of 
the country, and named after the regions in which 
they were used. For example, the Prakrit spoken 
in Magadha was known as Magadhi. 
Followers of Mahavira, who were known as 
Jainas, had to lead very simple lives, begging 
for food. They had to be absolutely honest, and 
were especially asked not to steal. Also, they 
had to observe celibacy. And men had to give up 
everything, including their clothes.
Rationalised 2023-24
57 
new questions  
and ideas
It was very difficult for most men and women to 
follow these strict rules. Nevertheless, thousands 
left their homes to learn and teach this new way 
of life. Many more remained behind and supported 
those who became monks and nuns, providing 
them with food. 
Jainism was supported mainly by traders. 
Farmers, who had to kill insects to protect their 
crops, found it more difficult to follow the rules. 
Over hundreds of years, Jainism spread to different 
parts of north India, and to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu 
and Karnataka. The teachings of Mahavira and 
his followers were transmitted orally for several 
centuries. They were written down in the form in 
which they are presently available at a place called 
Valabhi, in Gujarat, about 1500 years ago (see  
Map 7, page 87).
The sangha
Both the Mahavira and the Buddha felt that 
only those who left their homes could gain true 
knowledge. They arranged for them to stay together 
in the sangha, an association of those who left 
their homes. 
The rules made for the Buddhist sangha were 
written down in a book called the Vinaya Pitaka. 
From this, we know that there were separate 
branches for men and women. All men could join 
the sangha. However, children had to take the 
permission of their parents and slaves that of their

Women had to take their husbands’ permission.
Men and women who joined the sangha led

during fixed hours. That is why they were known

bhikkhunis. They taught others, and helped one 
another. They also held meetings to settle any 
quarrels that took place within the sangha. 
Those who joined the sangha included brahmins, 
kshatriyas, merchants, labourers, barbers, 
courtesans and slaves. Many of them wrote down 
the teachings of the Buddha. Some of them also 
composed beautiful poems, describing their life in 
the sangha. 
List at least two ways in which the sangha 
described in this lesson was different from the 
one mentioned in Chapter 5. Were there any 
similarities? 
Viharas
To begin with, both Jaina and Buddhist monks 
went from place to place throughout the year, 
teaching people. The only time they stayed in one 
place was during the rainy season, when it was 
very difficult to travel. Then, their supporters built 
temporary shelters for them in gardens, or they 
lived in natural caves in hilly areas.
As time went on, many 
supporters of the bhikkhus 
and bhikkhunis, and they 
themselves, felt the need for 
more permanent shelters 
and so monasteries were 
built. These were known 
as viharas. The earliest 
viharas were made of 
wood, and then of brick. 
Some were even in caves 
that were dug out in hills, 
especially in western India.

Stages of life: Ashramas
Ashram means a stage of life. 
Four ashramas were recognised: brahmacharya, grihastha, vanaprastha 
and samnyasa.
Brahmanas, kshatriyas and vaishyas were expected to lead simple lives 
and study the Vedas during the early years of their life (brahmacharya).
Then they had to marry and live as householders (grihastha).
Then they had to live in the forest and meditate (vanaprastha).
Finally, they had to give up everything and become samnyasins.
The system of ashramas allowed a person to spend some parts of their 
lives in meditation.
In what way was the system of ashramas different from life in the  
Sangha?
A Buddhist text tells us:
Just as the waters of rivers lose their names and separateness when they 
flow into the mighty ocean, so are varna and ranks and family forgotten 
when the followers of the Buddha join the order of monks.
Very often, the land on which the vihara was built 
was donated by a rich merchant or a landowner, 
or the king. The local people came with gifts of 
food, clothing and medicines for the bhikkhus and 
bhikkhunis. In return, they taught the people. Over 
the centuries, Buddhism spread to many parts of 
the subcontinent and beyond.
A new form of Buddhism, known as Mahayana 
Buddhism, now developed. This had two distinct 
features. Earlier, the Buddha’s presence was 
shown in sculpture by using certain signs. For 
instance, his attainment of enlightenment was 
shown by sculptures of the peepal tree. 
Now, statues of the Buddha were made. Many 
of these were made in Mathura, while others were 
made in Taxila. 
The second change was a belief in Bodhisattvas. 
These were supposed to be persons who had 
Rationalised 2023-24
attained enlightenment. Once they attained 
enlightenment, they could live in complete isolation 
and meditate in peace. However, instead of doing 
that, they remained in the world to teach and help 
other people. The worship of Bodhisattvas became 
very popular, and spread throughout Central Asia, 
China, and later to Korea and Japan. 
Buddhism spread to western and southern 
India, where dozens of caves were hollowed out of 
hills for bhikkhus to live in.
Buddhism also spread south eastwards, to  
Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of 
Southeast Asia including Indonesia. The older form 
of Buddhism, known as Theravada Buddhism was 
more popular in these areas.
Pilgrims
are men and women who undertake journeys to holy places in order to 
offer worship. The best-known of these are the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, 
Fa Xian, who came to the subcontinent about 1600 years ago, Xuan Zang 
(who came around 1400 years ago) and I-Qing, who came about 50 years 
after Xuan Zang. They came to visit places associated with the life of the 
Buddha as well as famous monasteries.   
Each of these pilgrims left an account of his journey. They wrote of 
the dangers they encountered on their travels, which often took years, of 
the countries and the monasteries that they visited, and the books they 
carried back with them.
Nalanda – A unique centre of learning
Xuan Zang, and other pilgrims spent time studying in Nalanda (Bihar), the 
most famous Buddhist monastery of the period. This is how he describes it:
“The teachers are men of the highest ability and talent. They follow the 
teachings of the Buddha in all sincerity. The rules of the monastery are 
strict, and everyone has to follow them. Discussions are held throughout 
the day, and the old and the young mutually help one another. Learned 
men from different cities come here to settle their doubts.  The gatekeeper 
asks new entrants difficult questions. They are allowed to enter only after 
they have been able to answer these. Seven or eight out of every ten are 
not able to answer.”

The lions that we see on our notes and coins 
have a long history. They were carved in stone, 
and placed on top of a massive stone pillar at 
Sarnath (about which you read in Chapter 6). 
Ashoka was one of the greatest rulers known 
to history and on his instructions inscriptions 
were inscribed on pillars, as well as on rock 
surfaces. Before we find out what was written in 
these inscriptions, let us see why his kingdom 
was called an empire.  
The empire that Ashoka ruled was founded 
by his grandfather, Chandragupta Maurya, 
more than 2300 years ago. Chandragupta was 
supported by a wise man named Chanakya 
or Kautilya. Many of Chanakya’s ideas were 
written down in a book called the Arthashastra.

probably lived in these cities.  
In other areas there were villages of farmers and

were forests where people gathered forest produce 
and hunted animals for food. People in different

They probably ate different kinds of food, and wore 
different kinds of clothes as well. 
How are empires different from kingdoms?
• Emperors need more resources than kings because 
empires are larger than kingdoms, and need to be 
protected by big armies.  
• So also they need a larger number of officials who 
collect taxes. 
Ruling the empire
As the empire was so large, different parts were 
ruled differently. The area around Pataliputra was 
under the direct control of the emperor. This meant 
that officials were appointed to collect taxes from 
farmers, herders, craftspersons and traders, who 
lived in villages and towns in the area. Officials 
also punished those who disobeyed the ruler’s 
orders. Many of these officials were given salaries. 
Messengers went to and fro, and spies kept a 
watch on the officials. And of course the emperor 
supervised them all, with the help of members of 
the royal family, and senior ministers.
There were other areas or provinces. Each of 
these was ruled from a provincial capital such as 
Taxila or Ujjain. Although there was some amount 
of control from Pataliputra, and royal princes were 
often sent as governors, local customs and rules 
were probably followed.
Besides, there were vast areas between these 
centres. Here the Mauryas tried to control roads 
and rivers, which were important for transport, and 
to collect whatever resources were available as tax 
and tribute. For example, the Arthashastra tells us 
that the north-west was important for blankets, 
and south India for its gold and precious stones. 
It is possible that these resources were collected 
as tribute.

Tribute
Unlike taxes, which were collected on a regular 
basis, tribute was collected as and when it was 
possible from people who gave a variety of things, 
more or less willingly.
There were also the forested regions. People 
living in these areas were more or less independent, 
but may have been expected to provide elephants, 
timber, honey and wax to Mauryan officials. 
The emperor and the capital city 
Megasthenes was an ambassador who was sent to 
the court of Chandragupta by the Greek ruler of 
West Asia named Seleucus Nicator. 
Megasthenes wrote an account about what he 
saw. Here is a part of his description:  
 “The occasions on which the emperor appears in 
public are celebrated with grand royal processions. 
He is carried in a golden palanquin. His guards ride 
elephants decorated with gold and silver. Some of 
the guards carry trees on which live birds, including 
a flock of trained parrots, circle about the head of 
the emperor. The king is normally surrounded by 
armed women. He is afraid that someone may try 
to kill him. He has special servants to taste the food 
before he eats. He never sleeps in the same bedroom 
for two nights.”
And about Pataliputra (modern Patna), he wrote:
“This is a large and beautiful city. It is surrounded 
by a massive wall. It has 570 towers and 64 gates. 
The houses, of two and three storeys, are built 
of wood and mud brick. The king’s palace is also 
of wood, and decorated with stone carvings. It 
is surrounded with gardens and enclosures for 
keeping birds.”
Why do you think the king had special servants 
to taste the food he ate?

Ashoka, a unique ruler
The most famous Mauryan ruler was Ashoka. He 
was the first ruler who tried to take his message to 
the people through inscriptions. Most of Ashoka’s 
inscriptions were in Prakrit and were written in 
the Brahmi script.
Ashoka’s war in Kalinga
Kalinga is the ancient name of coastal Orissa (see 
Map 5, page 63). Ashoka fought a war to conquer 
Kalinga. However, he was so horrified when he saw 
the violence and bloodshed that he decided not 
to fight any more wars. He is the only king in the 
history of the world who gave up conquest after 
winning a war. 
Ashoka’s inscription describing the Kalinga war
This is what Ashoka declared in one of his inscriptions: 
“Eight years after becoming king I conquered Kalinga. 
About a lakh and a half people were captured. And more than a lakh 
of people were killed. 
This filled me with sorrow. Why?
Whenever an independent land is conquered, lakhs of people die, and 
many are taken prisoner. Brahmins and monks also die.
People who are kind to their relatives and friends, to their slaves and 
servants die, or lose their loved ones.
That is why I am sad, and have decided to observe dhamma, and to 
teach others about it as well.
I believe that winning people over through dhamma is much better than 
conquering them through force.
I am inscribing this message for the future, so that my son and grandson 
after me should not think about war.
Instead, they should try to think about how to spread dhamma.”
How did the Kalinga war bring about a change in Ashoka’s attitude 
towards war?

and has now been placed 
in Rashtrapati Bhavan. It is

the sculptors of the time.
What was Ashoka’s dhamma?
Ashoka’s dhamma did not involve worship of a god, 
or performance of a sacrifice. He felt that just as a 
father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to 
instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the 
teachings of the Buddha (Chapter 6).
There were a number of problems that troubled 
him. People in the empire followed different 
religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. 
Animals were sacrificed. Slaves and servants were 
ill treated. Besides, there were quarrels in families 
and amongst neighbours. Ashoka felt it was his 
duty to solve these problems. So, he appointed 
officials, known as the dhamma 
mahamatta who went from 
place to place teaching people 
about dhamma. Besides, 
Ashoka got his messages 
inscribed on rocks and pillars, 
instructing his officials to read 
his message to those who could 
not read it themselves. 
Ashoka also sent messengers 
to spread ideas about dhamma 
to other lands, such as Syria, 
Egypt, Greece, and his son 
Mahendra and daughter 
Sanghmitra to Sri Lanka. Try 
and identify these on Map 6,

LOOKING AHEAD
The Mauryan empire collapsed about 2200 years ago. In its place (and elsewhere) rose 
several new kingdoms. In the north-west, and in parts of north India, kings known as 
the Indo-Greeks ruled for about one hundred years. They were followed by a Central 
Asian people known as the Shakas, who set up kingdoms 
in the north-west, north and western India. Some of these 
kingdoms lasted for about 500 years, till the Shakas   were 
defeated by the Gupta kings (Chapter 9). The Shakas in turn 
were followed by the Kushanas (about 2000 years ago). You 
will learn more about the Kushanas in Chapter 8. 
In the north, and in parts of 
central India, a general of the 
Mauryas, named Pushyamitra 
Shunga, set up a kingdom. The 
Shungas were followed by another 
dynasty, known as the Kanvas, and by rulers from other 
families till the establishment of the Gupta empire about 
1700 years ago.
The Shakas who ruled over parts of western India fought 
several battles with the Satavahanas, who ruled over western 
and parts of central India. The Satavahana kingdom, which was established about 
2100 years ago, lasted for about 400 years. Around 1700 years ago, a new ruling 
family, known as the Vakatakas, became powerful in central and western India. 
In south India, the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas ruled 
between 2200 and 1800 years ago. And, about 1500 years 
ago, there were two large kingdoms, those of the Pallavas 
and the Chalukyas. There were several other kingdoms 
and kings as well. We know about them from their coins 
and inscriptions, as well as from books. 
There were other changes that were taking place, in 
which ordinary men and women played a major role. 
These included the spread of 
agriculture and the growth of new 
towns, craft production and trade. 
Traders explored land routes within the subcontinent and 
outside, and sea routes to West Asia, East Africa and South 
East Asia (see Map 6) were also opened up. And many new 
buildings were built — including the earliest temples and 
stupas, books were written, and scientific discoveries were 
made. These developments took place simultaneously, i.e. 
at the same time. Keep this in mind as you read the rest 
of the book.

Iron tools and agriculture
We often take the use of iron for granted today. 
Things made of iron (and steel) are a part of 
our daily lives. The use of iron began in the 
subcontinent around 3000 years ago. Some of the 
largest collections of iron tools and weapons were 
found in the megalithic burials, about which you 
read in Chapter 4.
Around 2500 years ago, there is evidence for the 
growing use of iron tools. These included axes for 
clearing forests, and the iron ploughshare. As we 
had seen (Chapter 5), the ploughshare was useful 
for increasing agricultural production. 
Other steps to increase production: irrigation 
The kings and kingdoms you have been reading 
about could not have existed without the support 
of flourishing villages. While new tools and the 
system of transplantation (Chapter 5) increased 
production, irrigation was also used. Irrigation 
works that were built during this time included 
canals, wells, tanks, and artificial lakes.

In the northern part of the country, the village 
headman was known as the grama bhojaka. 
Usually, men from the same family held the 
position for generations. In other words, the post 
was hereditary. The grama bhojaka was often the 
largest landowner. Generally, he had slaves and 
hired workers to cultivate the land. Besides, as he 
was powerful, the king often used him to collect 
taxes from the village. He also functioned as a 
judge, and sometimes as a policeman. 
Apart from the grama bhojaka, there were other 
independent farmers, known as grihapatis, most 
of whom were smaller landowners. And then there 
were men and women such as the dasa karmakara, 
who did not own land, and had to earn a living 
working on the fields owned by others.  
In most villages there were also some  
craftspersons such as the blacksmith, potter, 
carpenter and weaver.
Coins
Archaeologists have found several thousands of 
coins belonging to this period. The earliest coins 
which were in use for about 500 years were 
punch-marked coins, such as the one shown here. 
The earliest Tamil compositions
Some of the earliest works in Tamil, known as 
Sangam literature, were composed around 2300 
years ago. These texts were called Sangam because 
they were supposed to have been composed and 
compiled in assemblies (known as sangams) of 
poets that were held in the city of Madurai (see

Mathura (Map 7, page 87). 
Mathura has been an important settlement for 
more than 2500 years. It was important because it 
was located at the cross roads of two major routes 
of travel and trade — from the northwest to the east 
and from north to south. There were fortifications 
around the city, and several shrines. Farmers and 
herders from adjoining areas provided food for 
Punch-marked Coins
Punch-marked coins were generally rectangular 
or sometimes square or round in shape, either cut 
out of metal sheets or made out of flattened metal 
globules (a small spherical body). The coins were not 
inscribed, but were stamped with symbols using dies 
or punches. Hence, they are called punch-marked 
coins. These coins are found over most parts of the 
subcontinent and remained in circulation till the 
early centuries CE.
Other means of exchange 
Read this short poem from the Sangam collection:
 As they carry the white paddy of their land
 To exchange it for the salt of another,
 Crossing the long roads in carts,
 Through sands white as moonlight,
 Taking whole families,
 Who hate to be left behind,
 The departure of the salt merchants
 Leaves the city empty.

some extremely fine sculpture was produced. 
Around 2000 years ago, Mathura became the 
second capital of the Kushanas, about whom you 
would read. Mathura was also a religious centre — 
there were Buddhist monasteries, Jaina shrines, 
and it was an important centre for the worship of 
Krishna.
Several inscriptions on surfaces such as stone 
slabs and statues have been found in Mathura. 
Generally, these are short inscriptions, recording 
gifts made by men (and sometimes women) to 
monasteries and shrines. These were made by 
kings and queens, officers, merchants, and 
craftspersons who lived in the city. For instance, 
inscriptions from Mathura mention goldsmiths, 
blacksmiths, weavers, basket makers, garland 
makers, perfumers. 
Make a list of the occupations of people who 
lived in Mathura. List one occupation that was not 
practised in Harappan cities. 
Crafts and craftspersons
We also have archaeological evidence 
for crafts. These include extremely fine 
pottery, known as the Northern Black 
Polished Ware (NBPW). It gets its name 
from the fact that it is generally found in 
the northern part of the subcontinent. 
Remember that the archaeological 
evidence for many crafts may not have 
survived. We know from texts that the 
manufacture of cloth was important. 
There were famous centres such as 
Varanasi in the north, and Madurai in 
the south. Both men and women worked 
in these centres.
Northern Black Polished 
Ware (NBPW)
NBPW is a hard, wheel 
made, metallic looking 
ware with a shiny black 
surface. The potter used to 
expose the earthenware to 
very high temperature in 
his kiln which resulted in 
the blackening of its outer 
surface. A fine black slip 
was also applied on this, 
which gave the pottery a 
mirror-like shine.

Trade and traders  
You have read about the Northern Black Polished 
Ware. This fine pottery, especially bowls and 
plates, were found from several archaeological sites 
throughout the subcontinent. How do you think it 
reached these places? Traders may have carried 
them from the places where they were made, to 
sell them at other places. 
South India was famous for gold, spices, 
especially pepper, and precious stones. Pepper 
was particularly valued in the Roman Empire, 
so much so that it was known as black gold. So, 
traders carried many of these goods to Rome in 
ships, across the sea, and by land in caravans. 
There must have been quite a lot of trade as many 
Roman gold coins have been found in south India. 
Can you think of how and why these reached 
India?
A poem about trade 
We can find evidence of trade in the Sangam poems.  
Here is one which describes the goods brought 
into Puhar, an important port on the east coast:
 
“(Here are brought)
 
Swift, prancing horses by sea in ships,
 
Bales of black pepper in carts,
 
Gems and gold born in the Himalayas,

Traders explored several sea routes. Some of 
these followed the coasts. There were others across 
the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, where sailors 
took advantage of the monsoon winds to cross the 
seas more quickly. So, if they wanted to reach the 
western coast of the subcontinent from East Africa 
or Arabia, they chose to sail with the south-west 
monsoon. And sturdy ships had to be built for these 
long journeys. 
New kingdoms along the coasts
The southern half of the subcontinent is marked 
by a long coastline, and with hills, plateaus, and 
river valleys. Amongst the river valleys, that of the 
Kaveri is the most fertile. Chiefs and kings who 
controlled the river valleys and the coasts became 
rich and powerful. Sangam poems mention the 
muvendar. This is a Tamil word meaning three 
chiefs, used for the heads of three ruling families, 
the Cholas, Cheras, and Pandyas (see Map 7, page 
87), who became powerful in south India around 
2300 years ago. 
Each of the three chiefs had two centres of power: 
one inland, and one on the coast. Of these six cities, 
two were very important: Puhar or Kaveripattinam, 
the port of the Cholas, and Madurai, the capital of 
the Pandyas.
The chiefs did not collect regular taxes. Instead, 
they demanded and received gifts from the people. 
They also went on military expeditions, and 
collected tribute from neighbouring areas. They 
kept some of the wealth and distributed the rest 
amongst their supporters, including members of 
their family, soldiers, and poets. Many poets whose 
compositions are found in the Sangam collection 
composed poems in praise of chiefs who often

rewarded them with precious stones, gold, horses, 
elephants, chariots, and fine cloth. 
Around 200 years later, a dynasty known as the 
Satavahanas became powerful in western India (see 
Map 7, page 87). The most important ruler of the 
Satavahanas was Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni. 
We know about him from an inscription composed 
on behalf of his mother, Gautami Balashri. He and 
other Satavahana rulers were known as lords of the 
dakshinapatha, literally the route leading to the 
south, which was also used as a name for the entire 
southern region. He sent his army to the eastern, 
western and southern coasts.  
Why do you think he wanted to control the 
coasts? 
Silk Route and the Kushanas 
Some kings tried to control large portions of the 
route. This was because they could benefit from 
taxes, tributes and gifts that were brought by traders 
travelling along the route. In return, they often 
protected the traders who passed through their 
kingdoms from attacks by robbers. 
The best-known of the rulers who controlled the 
Silk Route were the Kushanas, who ruled over central 
Asia and north-west India around 2000 years ago. 
Their two major centres of power were Peshawar and 
Mathura. Taxila was also included in their kingdom. 
During their rule, a branch of the Silk Route extended 
from Central Asia down to the seaports at the mouth 
of the river Indus, from where silk was shipped 
westwards to the Roman Empire.

CHAPTER 9
NEW EMPIRES AND KINGDOMS
Prashastis and what they tell us
Arvind was supposed to be acting as Samudragupta, 
a famous ruler of a dynasty known as the 
Guptas. We know about Samudragupta from a 
long inscription, inscribed on the Ashokan pillar 
at Allahabad. It was composed as a Kavya by 
Harishena, who was a poet and a minister at the 
court of Samudragupta. 
This inscription is of a special kind known as 
a prashasti, a Sanskrit word, meaning ‘in praise 
of’. While prashastis were composed for some of 
the rulers you read about in Chapter 8, such as 
Gautamiputra Shri Satakarni, they became far 
more important from the time of the Guptas. 
Samudragupta’s prashasti
Let us see what Samudragupta’s prashasti tells us. 
The poet praised the king in glowing terms — as 
a warrior, as a king who won victories in battle, 
who was learned and the best of poets. He is also 
described as equal to the gods. The prashasti was 
composed in very long sentences. Here is a part of 
one such sentence: 
Arvind plays a king
Arvind had been chosen to act as a king in the school play. 
He had expected to march solemnly in splendid robes, to 
twirl his moustaches and wield the silver-paper wrapped 
sword with gusto. Imagine his surprise when he was told 
he would also have to sit and play a veena, and recite 
poetry! A musician-king? Who was that? he wondered.

the plenteous beauty of the marks of hundreds of 
scars caused by battle-axes, arrows, spikes, spears, 
barbed darts, swords, iron clubs, javelins, barbed 
arrows, long arrows and many other weapons.
What does this description tell you about the 
king? And also about how kings fought wars?
If you look at Map 7 (page 87), you will notice 
an area shaded in green. You will also find a series 
of red dots along the east coast. And you will find 
areas marked in purple and blue as well.
This map is based on the information provided 
in the prashasti. Harishena describes four different 
kinds of rulers, and tells us about Samudragupta’s 
policies towards them. 
1. The rulers of Aryavarta, the area shaded in green 
on the map. Here there were nine rulers who were 
uprooted, and their kingdoms were made a part of 
Samudragupta’s empire.
2. The rulers of Dakshinapatha. Here there were 
twelve rulers, some of whose capitals are marked 
with red dots on the map. They surrendered to 
Samudragupta after being defeated and he then 
allowed them to rule again. 
3. The inner circle of neighbouring states, including 
Assam, coastal Bengal, Nepal, and a number of 
gana sanghas (remember Chapter 5) in the north-
west, marked in purple on the map. They brought 
tribute, followed his orders, and attended his court.
4. The rulers of the outlying areas, marked in blue on 
the map, perhaps the descendants of the Kushanas 
and Shakas, and the ruler of Sri Lanka, who 
submitted to him and offered daughters in  
marriage.

Vikram Samvat
The era beginning in the 
58 BCE is traditionally 
associated with Gupta 
king, Chandragupta 
II, who had founded 
it as a mark of victory 
over the Shakas and 
assumed the title of 
Vikramaditya.
Genealogies 
Most prashastis also mention the ancestors of 
the ruler. This one mentions Samudragupta’s 
great grandfather, grandfather, father and 
mother. His mother, Kumara devi, belonged 
to the Lichchhavi gana, while his father, 
Chandragupta, was the first ruler of the Gupta 
dynasty to adopt the grand title of maharaj-
adhiraja, a title that Samudragupta also used. 
His great grandfather and grandfather are 
mentioned simply as maha-rajas. It seems 
as if the family gradually rose to importance. 
Arrange these titles in order of importance: raja, 
maharaj-adhiraja, maha-raja. 
Samudragupta in turn figures in the genealogies 
(lists of ancestors) of later rulers of the dynasty, such 
as his son, Chandragupta II. We know about him 
from inscriptions and coins. He led an expedition 
to western India, where he overcame the last of the 
Shakas. According to later belief, his court was full 
of learned people. About some of them you will read 
in Chapter 10. 
Harshavardhana and the Harshacharita
While we can learn about the Gupta rulers from 
their inscriptions and coins, we can find out about 
some kings from biographies. Harshavardhana, 
who ruled nearly 1400 years ago, was one such 
ruler. His court poet, Banabhatta, wrote his 
biography, the Harshacharita, in Sanskrit. This 
gives us the genealogy of Harsha, and ends with 
his becoming king. Xuan Zang, about whom  
you read in Chapter 8, also spent a lot of time  
at Harsha’s court and left a detailed account of 
what he saw. 
Rationalised 2023-24

Harsha was not the eldest son of his father, 
but became king of Thanesar after both his father 
and elder brother died. His brother-in-law was the 
ruler of Kanauj (see Map 7) and he was killed by 
the ruler of Bengal. Harsha took over the kingdom 
of Kanauj, and then led an army against the ruler 
of Bengal. 
Although he was successful in the east, and 
conquered Magadha and probably Bengal also, 
he was not as successful elsewhere. He tried to 
cross the Narmada to march into the Deccan, but 
was stopped by a ruler belonging to the Chalukya 
dynasty, Pulakeshin II.
Look at political map of India and list the 
present-day states which Harshavardhana passed 
through when he went (a) to Bengal and (b) up to 
the Narmada. 
The Pallavas, Chalukyas and Pulakeshin’s prashasti
The Pallavas and Chalukyas were the most 
important ruling dynasties in south India during 
this period. The kingdom of the Pallavas spread 
from the region around their capital, Kanchipuram, 
to the Kaveri delta, while that of the Chalukyas was 
centred around the Raichur Doab, between the 
rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra. 
Aihole, the capital of the Chalukyas, was an 
important trading centre (see Map 7). It developed 
as a religious centre, with a number of temples. 
The Pallavas and Chalukyas frequently raided one 
another’s lands, especially attacking the capital 
cities, which were prosperous towns. 
The best-known Chalukya ruler was Pulakeshin 
II. We know about him from a prashasti, composed 
by his court poet Ravikirti. This tells us about 
his ancestors, who are traced back through 
four generations from father to son. Pulakeshin 
evidently got the kingdom from his uncle.
Rationalised 2023-24

According to Ravikirti, he led expeditions along 
both the west and the east coasts. Besides, he 
checked the advance of Harsha. There is an 
interesting play of words in the poem. Harsha 
means happiness. The poet says that after this 
defeat, Harsha was no longer Harsha! Pulakeshin 
also attacked the Pallava king, who took shelter 
behind the walls of Kanchipuram. 
But the Chalukya victory was short-lived. 
Ultimately, both the Pallavas and the Chalukyas 
gave way to new rulers belonging to the Rashtrakuta 
and Chola dynasties, about which you will study 
in Class VII. 
Who were the other rulers who tried to control 
the coasts and why? (Hint: see Chapter 8).
How were these kingdoms administered?
As in the case of earlier kings, land revenue 
remained important for these rulers, and the village 
remained the basic unit of administration. 
There were some new developments as well. Kings 
adopted a number of steps to win the support of 
men who were powerful, either economically, or 
socially, or because of their political and military 
strength. For instance:
• Some important administrative posts were now 
hereditary. This means that sons succeeded fathers 
to these posts. For example, the poet Harishena was 
a maha-danda-nayaka, or chief judicial officer, like 
his father. 
• Sometimes, one person held many offices. For 
instance, besides being a maha-danda-nayaka, 
Harishena was a kumar-amatya, meaning an 
important minister, and a sandhi-vigrahika, 
meaning a minister of war and peace. 
• Besides, important men probably had a say in 
local administration. These included the nagara-
shreshthi or chief banker or merchant of the city,

91 
new empires and

the sarthavaha or leader of the merchant caravans, 
the prathama-kulika or the chief craftsman, and the 
head of the kayasthas or scribes. 
These policies were reasonably effective, but 
sooner or later, some of these powerful men grew 
strong enough to set up independent kingdoms. 
What do you think may have been the advantages 
and disadvantages of having hereditary officers? 
A new kind of army
Like earlier rulers, some of these kings maintained 
a well-organised army, with elephants, chariots, 
cavalry and foot soldiers. Besides, there were 
military leaders who provided the king with troops 
whenever he needed them. They were not paid 
regular salaries. Instead, some of them received 
grants of land. They collected revenue from the 
land and used this to maintain soldiers and horses, 
and provide equipment for warfare. These men 
were known as samantas. Whenever the ruler was 
weak, samantas tried to become independent. 
Assemblies in the southern kingdoms 
The inscriptions of the Pallavas mention a 
number of local assemblies. These included 
the sabha, which was an assembly of brahmin 
landowners. This assembly functioned through 
sub-committees, which looked after irrigation, 
agricultural operations, making roads, local 
temples, etc. 
The ur was a village assembly found in areas 
where the landowners were not brahmins. And the 
nagaram was an organisation of merchants. It is 
likely that these assemblies were controlled by rich 
and powerful landowners and merchants. Many of 
these local assemblies continued to function for 
centuries.

Ordinary people in the kingdoms
We can catch an occasional glimpse of the lives of 
ordinary people from plays, and other accounts. 
Let us look at some of these.
Kalidasa is known for his plays depicting life in 
the king’s court. An interesting feature about these 
plays is that the king and most brahmins are shown 
as speaking Sanskrit, while women and men other 
than the king and brahmins use Prakrit. His most 
famous play, ‘Abhijnana Shakuntalam’, is the 
story of the love between a king named Dushyanta 
and a young woman named Shakuntala. We find 
an interesting description of the plight of a poor 
fisherman in this play.
A fisherman finds a ring
A fisherman found a precious ring, which the king 
had given to Shakuntala, but which had been 
accidentally swallowed by a fish. When he went 
to the palace with it, the gatemen accused him of 
theft, and the chief police officer was rather rude. 
However, the king was happy when he saw the 
ring and sent a reward for the fisherman. Then, 
the police officer and the gatemen decided to take 
a share of the reward, and went along with the 
fisherman to have a drink.
Do you think that if a poor man finds something 
and reports this to the police he would be treated 
like this today?

The Chinese pilgrim Fa Xian noticed the plight 
of those who were treated as untouchables by the 
high and mighty. They were expected to live on 
the outskirts of the city. He writes: “If such a man 
enters a town or a market place, he strikes a piece 
of wood, in order to keep himself separate; people, 
hearing this sound, know what it means and avoid 
touching him or brushing against him.”
And Banabhatta provides us with a vivid picture 
of the king’s army on the move:
The king’s army
The king travelled with an enormous amount of 
equipment. Apart from weapons, there were things

musicians beating drums, and others playing horns 
and trumpets.  
Villagers had to provide hospitality along the 
way. They came with gifts of curds, gur and flowers, 
and provided fodder for the animals. They also tried 
to meet the king, and place their complaints and 
petitions before him. 
The army left a trail of destruction behind.

The iron pillar
CHAPTER 10
BUILDINGS, PAINTINGS AND BOOKS
Metallurgy
Ancient Indian metallurgists made major 
contributions to the metallurgical history of the 
world. Archaeological excavations have shown 
that the Harappans were master craftsmen and 
had knowledge of copper metallurgy. They even 
manufactured bronze by mixing copper and tin. 
While the Harappans belonged to the Bronze Age, 
their successors belonged to the Iron Age. India 
produced highly advanced types of iron-forged 
iron, wrought iron and cast iron.
The iron pillar
The iron pillar at 
Mehrauli, Delhi, is a 
remarkable example 
of the skill of Indian 
craftspersons. It is 
made of iron, 7.2m 
high, and weighs over 
3 tonnes. It was made 
about 1500 years 
ago. We know the 
date because there is an inscription on the pillar 
mentioning a ruler named Chandra, who probably 
belonged to the Gupta dynasty (Chapter 9). What 
is amazing is the fact that the pillar has not rusted 
through the centuries.
Buildings in brick and stone
The skills of our crafts persons are also apparent in 
the buildings that have survived, such as stupas. 
The word stupa means a mound. While there 
are several kinds of stupas, round and tall, big 
and small, these have certain common features. 
Generally, there is a small box placed at the centre 
or heart of the stupa. This may contain bodily 
remains (such as teeth, bone or ashes) of the 
Marutasami and the iron pillar
Marutasami was so excited. His brother had propelled 
his wheelchair all along the dusty, stony path, past the 
Qutb Minar, and up the metal ramp. It had been tough, 
but now he was here, in front of the famous iron pillar. 
It was an unforgettable experience.

This box, known as a relic

Later, a layer of mud brick or 
baked brick was added on top. 
And then, the dome like structure 
was sometimes covered with 
carved stone slabs. 
Often, a path, known as the 
pradakshina patha, was laid 
around the stupa. This was 
surrounded with railings. Entrance 
to the path was through gateways. 
Devotees walked around the 
stupa, in a clockwise direction, as 
a mark of devotion.  Both railings 
and gateways were often decorated 
with sculpture. 
Find Amaravati on Map 7 (page 87). This was 
a place where a magnificent stupa once existed. 
Many of the stone carvings for decorating the stupa 
were made about 2000 years ago. 
Other buildings were hollowed out of rock to 
make artificial caves. Some of these were very 
elaborately decorated 
with sculptures and 
painted walls.

performed religious rituals, and devotees offered 
worship to the deity. 
Often, as at Bhitargaon, a tower, known as the 
shikhara, was built on top of the garbhagriha, to 
mark this out as a sacred place. Building shikharas 
required careful planning. Most temples also had a 
space known as the mandapa. It was a hall where 
people could assemble.

Can you see how some of

How were stupas and temples built? 
There were several stages in building a stupa or 
a temple. Usually, kings or queens decided to 
build these as it was an expensive affair. First, 
good quality stone had to be found, quarried, and 
transported to the place that was often carefully 
chosen for the new building. Here, these rough 
blocks of stone had to be shaped and carved into 
pillars, and panels for walls, floors and ceilings. 
And then these had to be placed in precisely the 
right position. 
Kings and queens probably spent money from 
their treasury to pay the craftspersons who worked 
to build these splendid structures. Besides, when 
devotees came to visit the temple or the stupa, 
they often brought gifts, which were used 
to decorate the buildings. For example, 
an association of ivory workers paid 
for one of the beautiful gateways at 
Sanchi.  
Among the others who paid 
for decorations were merchants, 
farmers, garland makers,perfumers, 
smiths, and hundreds of men and 
women who are known only by their 
names which were inscribed on pillars, 
railings and walls. So when you get a

is a place where several caves were 
hollowed out of the hills over centuries. 
Most of these were monasteries for 
Buddhist monks, and some of them 
were decorated with paintings. Here 
are some examples. As the caves are 
dark inside, most of these paintings 
were done in the light of torches. The 
colours, which are vivid even after 
1500 years, were made of plants and minerals.

The world of books
Some of the best-known epics were written during 
this period. Epics are grand, long compositions, 
about heroic men and women, and include stories 
about gods. 
A famous Tamil epic, the Silappadikaram, was 
composed by a poet named Ilango, around 1800 
years ago. It is the story of a merchant named 
Kovalan, who lived in Puhar and fell in love with 
a courtesan named Madhavi, neglecting his wife 
Kannagi. Later, he and Kannagi left Puhar and 
went to Madurai, where he was wrongly accused of 
theft by the court jeweller of the Pandya king. The 
king sentenced Kovalan to death. Kannagi, who 
still loved him, was full of grief and anger at this 
injustice, and destroyed the entire city of Madurai. 
A description from the Silappadikaram
Here is how the poet describes Kannagi’s grief:
“O witness of my grief, you cannot console me. 
Is it right that your body, fairer than pure gold, lies 
unwashed here in the dust? Is it just that in the red 
glow of the twilight, your handsome chest, framed 
with a flower wreath, lies thrown down on the bare 
earth, while I remain alone, helpless and abandoned 
to despair? Is there no god? Is there no god in this 
country? Can there be a god in a land where the 
sword of the king is used for the murder of innocent 
strangers? Is there no god, no god?”
Another Tamil epic, the Manimekalai was 
composed by Sattanar around 1400 years ago. This 
describes the story of the daughter of Kovalan and 
Madhavi. These beautiful compositions were lost to 
scholars for many centuries, till their manuscripts 
were rediscovered, about a hundred years ago. 
Other writers, such as Kalidasa, (about whom 
you read in Chapter 9) wrote in Sanskrit.

A verse from the ‘Meghaduta’
Here is a verse from Kalidasa’s best-known poem, the 
‘Meghaduta’, in which a monsoon cloud is imagined 
to be a messenger between lovers who are separated 
from one another. 
See how the poet describes the breeze that will 
carry the cloud northwards:
“A cool breeze, delightful as it is touched 
With the fragrance of the earth
Swollen by your showers, 
Inhaled deeply by elephants, 
And causing the wild figs to ripen, 
Will blow gently as you go.”
Do you think Kalidasa can be described as a lover 
of nature? 
Recording and preserving old stories
A number of Hindu religious stories that were in 
circulation earlier were written down around the 
same time. These include the Puranas. Purana 
literally means old. The Puranas contain stories 
about gods and goddesses, such as Vishnu, Shiva, 
Durga or Parvati. They also contain details on 
how they were to be worshipped. Besides, there 
are accounts about the creation of the world, and 
about kings.  
The Puranas were written in simple Sanskrit 
verse, and were meant to be heard by everybody. 
They were probably recited in temples by priests, 
and people came to listen to them.
Two Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and 
Ramayana had been popular for a very long time. 
Some of you may be familiar with these stories. 
The Mahabharata is about a war fought between 
the Kauravas and Pandavas, who were cousins.

This was a war to gain control of the throne of the 
Kurus, and their capital, Hastinapura. The story 
itself was an old one, but was written down in 
the form in which we know it today, about 1500 
years ago. Both the Puranas and the Mahabharata 
are supposed to have been compiled by Vyasa. 
The Bhagavad Gita, about which you learnt in  
Chapter 8, was also included in the Mahabharata. 
The Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, 
who was sent into exile. His wife Sita was abducted 
by the king of Lanka, named Ravana, and Rama 
had to fight a battle to get her back. He won and 
returned to Ayodhya, the capital of Kosala, after his 
victory. Like the Mahabharata, this was an old story 
that was now written down. Valmiki is recognised 
as the author of the Sanskrit Ramayana.
There are several versions (many of which are 
performed) of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, 
popular amongst people in different parts of the 
subcontinent. Find out about a version in your 
state.
Stories told by ordinary people
Ordinary people also told stories, composed poems 
and songs, sang, danced, and performed plays. 
Some of these are preserved in collections of 
stories, such as the Jatakas and the Panchatantra, 
which were written down around this time. Stories 
from the Jatakas were often shown on the railings 
of stupas and in paintings in places such as Ajanta. 
Here is one such story:
Rationalised 2023-24
The story of the monkey king
Once upon a time there was a great monkey king, 
who lived on the banks of the Ganga in the Himalayas, 
with 80,000 followers. They fed on the fruit of a 
special mango tree, which were very sweet. Such 
exquisite mangoes did not grow on the plains. One 
day, a ripe mango fell into the river and floated all 
the way to Varanasi. There the king of the city who 
was bathing in the river found it, and was amazed 
when he tasted it. He asked the foresters of his 
kingdom whether they could find the tree for him, 
and they led him all the way to the Himalayas. There, 
the king and his courtiers had their fill of mangoes. 
At night, the king discovered that the 
monkeys were also feasting on the 
fruit, and decided to kill them.  
However, the king of 
the monkeys worked 
out a plan to save his 
followers. He broke off 
branches of the mango 
tree, and tied them to 
form a ‘bridge’ across 
the river, and held 
on to one end till all 
his followers crossed 
over. Exhausted with 
the effort, he fell down 
and lay dying. 
The human king saw 
what had happened, and 
tried unsuccessfully to revive 
the monkey. When he died, the 
king mourned his death and paid 
him full respect.  
 This story is shown on a piece of sculpture found 
from a stupa at Bharhut in central India. Can you

Ayurveda is a well-known system of

A quick look at dates
Throughout the book, we have used approximate dates to give you 
a rough idea of when events/processes took place, using the year 
2000 as our starting point. Generally, the letter c., which stands for 
the Latin word circa, meaning ‘approximate’ is used for such dates.
You will find dates written differently in other books that you 
may use.
 For instance, for the Palaeolithic period (Chapter 2), dates may be 
mentioned in terms of millions of years ago, written as mya
 The beginning of farming and herding at Mehrgarh (Chapter 2) 
dates to c. 6000 BC/ BCE
 The Harappan cities flourished between c. 2700 and 1900 BCE
 The Rigveda was composed between c. 1500 and 1000 BCE
 Mahajanapadas and cities developed in the Ganga valley and new 
ideas associated with the Upanishads, Jainism and Buddhism 
emerged  c. 500 BCE
 Alexander invaded the northwest c. 327–325 BCE
 Chandragupta Maurya became king c. 321 BCE
 Ashoka ruled between c. 272/268 to 231 BCE
 The composition of the Sangam texts, c. 300 BCE–300 CE
 The reign of Kanishka, c. 78–100 CE
 The establishment of the Gupta empire, c. 320 CE
 The compilation of the Jaina texts at the council at Valabhi, c. 
512/521 CE
 The rule of Harshavardhana, 606–647 CE
 Xuan Zang comes to India, 630–643 CE
 The rule of Pulakeshin II, 609–642 CE. 
In some cases, for example, the date from when Ashoka began to 
rule, you may find that more than one date is shown. This is because 
historians have not been able to agree on which is the correct date. Dates 
with question marks after them indicate that these are uncertain.
